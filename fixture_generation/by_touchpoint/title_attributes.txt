## ErrImproperTitleAttribute

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/TitleAttributes/ErrImproperTitleAttribute_002_correct_usage.html
  - Fixtures/TitleAttributes/ErrImproperTitleAttribute_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrImproperTitleAttribute
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 5.2.4 Accessible Documentation (Conformance Requirement), 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: title_attributes
Description: Title attribute used in particularly problematic patterns (on non-focusable elements or duplicating visible text)
Why it matters: Title attributes fundamentally fail WCAG Conformance requirement 5.2.4 as they are inaccessible to screen magnifier users. At high magnification, tooltip content extends off-screen and disappears when mouse moves, making content completely inaccessible. This error flags specific patterns that are especially problematic: (1) title on non-focusable elements like div/span where users cannot even trigger the tooltip, and (2) redundant titles that duplicate visible text providing no value. These patterns demonstrate particularly poor understanding of accessibility requirements and should never be used
Who it affects: Screen magnifier users at high magnification (tooltip goes off-screen and disappears), mobile and touch screen users (no hover capability), keyboard-only users (cannot trigger non-focusable element tooltips), screen reader users (inconsistent announcement), users with motor disabilities (tooltip disappears when mouse moves)
How to fix: Never use title attributes on body elements. For non-focusable containers (div, span), remove the title entirely and make information visible. For redundant titles, simply remove the title attribute. Use visible text, proper label elements, aria-label for interactive elements, or visible helper text instead

## WarnVagueTitleAttribute

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/TitleAttributes/WarnVagueTitleAttribute_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/TitleAttributes/WarnVagueTitleAttribute_002_correct_informative.html

ID: WarnVagueTitleAttribute
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 5.2.4 Accessible Documentation (Conformance Requirement), 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: title_attributes
Description: Title attribute contains vague or generic text that provides no useful information
Why it matters: Title attributes fundamentally fail WCAG 5.2.4 - screen magnifier users at high magnification cannot read tooltips as content goes off-screen and disappears when mouse moves. This warning flags titles with particularly uninformative content like "Click here", "Link", "Button", or other generic phrases. While all title attributes are problematic due to magnification issues, vague titles compound the problem by providing no value even for users who can access them. This represents poor quality content that demonstrates misunderstanding of accessible design
Who it affects: Screen magnifier users at high magnification (fundamental inaccessibility), mobile and touch users (no hover), keyboard users (inconsistent access), and all users who would benefit from clear, descriptive supplementary information but instead get generic phrases
How to fix: Never use title attributes in the first place (they fail WCAG 5.2.4). If you must use them despite accessibility concerns, at minimum avoid vague generic phrases like "Click here", "Link", or "Button". Better solution: Remove title attributes entirely and use visible text, proper labels, aria-label for interactive elements, or visible helper text. Don't hide important information in tooltips that many users cannot access
