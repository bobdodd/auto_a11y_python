- [ ] Verify execution stats updated
- [ ] Test page without setup script (should skip)
- [ ] Test page with disabled script (should skip)

## Manual Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cookie Dismissal

**Setup:**
1. Find a test page with cookie notice
2. Create script with WAIT_FOR_SELECTOR and CLICK steps
3. Associate script with page

**Test:**
1. Run accessibility test on page
2. Verify script runs (check logs)
3. Verify cookie banner dismissed
4. Verify accessibility tests run on page without banner
5. Check execution stats in database

**Expected:**
- Script executes successfully
- Cookie banner removed
- Tests run normally
- Stats show: success_count = 1, average_duration_ms > 0

### Scenario 2: Selector Not Found

**Setup:**
1. Create script with invalid selector
2. Associate with page

**Test:**
1. Run accessibility test on page
2. Verify script fails (check logs)
3. Verify error screenshot captured
4. Verify tests continue despite failure
5. Check execution stats

**Expected:**
- Script fails with "Element not found" error
- Error screenshot saved to screenshots/script_debug/
- Tests run normally (not blocked by script failure)
- Stats show: failure_count = 1

### Scenario 3: Environment Variable

**Setup:**
1. Create script with `${ENV:TEST_PASSWORD}` in TYPE step
2. Set environment variable: `export TEST_PASSWORD='testpass'`
3. Associate with page

**Test:**
1. Run accessibility test
2. Verify password substituted (check debug screenshot or logs)
3. Verify script executes successfully

**Expected:**
- `${ENV:TEST_PASSWORD}` replaced with `'testpass'`
- Script succeeds

### Scenario 4: Validation Rules

**Setup:**
1. Create script with validation rules
2. Add success_selector: '.logged-in'
3. Add failure_selector: '.error-message'

**Test:**
1. Run on page where .logged-in appears
2. Verify script succeeds
3. Run on page where .error-message appears
4. Verify script fails

**Expected:**
- Script validates correctly
- Success/failure detected properly

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Review all code changes
- [ ] Run syntax checks

- [ ] Review documentation
- [ ] Check git status

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Commit changes to git
2. [ ] Create descriptive commit message
3. [ ] Push to repository (if applicable)
4. [ ] Deploy to environment
5. [ ] MongoDB indexes created automatically on first run
6. [ ] Verify collection created: `db.page_setup_scripts.find()`

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Check execution statistics

---

## Verification Commands

### Check Database Collection

```javascript
// In MongoDB shell
use auto_a11y

// Check collection exists
show collections

// Check indexes
db.page_setup_scripts.getIndexes()

// Count scripts
db.page_setup_scripts.count()
```

### Check Python Imports

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "from auto_a11y.models import PageSetupScript; print('✅ Import OK')"
```

### Test Script Creation

```bash
python examples/create_cookie_script.py
```

### Check Logs

```bash
tail -f logs/auto_a11y.log | grep -i script
```
