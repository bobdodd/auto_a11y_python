        <h2>Understanding Typography</h2>
        <p>Typography plays a crucial role in web design and accessibility. The choice of fonts can significantly impact readability for users with various visual and cognitive needs.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
            "Good typography is invisible. Bad typography cannot be ignored."
        </blockquote>

        <p>When selecting fonts, consider factors such as x-height, letter spacing, and overall legibility. Some fonts that may seem artistic or creative can actually create barriers for users with dyslexia or low vision.</p>
