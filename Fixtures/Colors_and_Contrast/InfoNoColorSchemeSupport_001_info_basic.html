    <h1>Understanding Web Accessibility</h1>

    <article>
        <p>Web accessibility ensures that websites are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. This includes visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive accessibility considerations.</p>

        <p>Color scheme preferences are an important part of visual accessibility, allowing users to choose between light and dark themes based on their environment and visual comfort needs.</p>

        <h2>Key Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Perceivable: Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive</li>
            <li>Operable: Interface components must be operable by all users</li>
            <li>Understandable: Information and operation must be understandable</li>
            <li>Robust: Content must work with current and future technologies</li>
        </ul>
