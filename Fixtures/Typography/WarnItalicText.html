    <h1>Excessive Italic Text Usage</h1>
    
    <!-- Entire paragraph in italics -->
    <p class="italic-paragraph">
        This entire paragraph is in italics, which can be difficult to read for extended periods.
        Italic text should be used sparingly for emphasis, not for large blocks of content.
        Extended italic text can cause eye strain and reduce reading speed.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Long italic section -->
    <div class="large-italic-block">
        <p>This is a large block of italic text that spans multiple lines and paragraphs.</p>
        <p>Using italics for extended content makes it harder to scan and comprehend.</p>
        <p>Screen readers don't distinguish italic text, so meaning shouldn't depend on it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Multiple italic elements -->
    <i>This uses the i tag for italic text, which is semantically unclear.</i>
    <em style="display: block; margin: 10px 0;">
        This entire emphasis block is italicized, reducing readability for long content.
        The em tag is better semantically but still shouldn't be used for large text blocks.
