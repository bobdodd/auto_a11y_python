# Info and Discovery Categories Update - Summary

## Problem Statement
The application was incorrectly counting Info and Discovery items as accessibility violations, which inflated the violation count and made compliance scores inaccurate.

## Key Clarifications

### What ARE Violations
- **Errors**: WCAG failures that must be fixed
- **Warnings**: Potential accessibility issues that should be addressed
- **Impact on Compliance**: These count toward compliance scores and legal risk

### What are NOT Violations

#### Info (Informational Items)
- **Purpose**: General reporting of non-violating items for awareness
- **Examples**:
  - Reporting that alt text exists (positive finding)
  - Noting the presence of ARIA labels
  - Confirming proper heading structure
  - Listing accessibility features that ARE working
- **Impact**: Do NOT count as violations, provide context only

#### Discovery (Manual Testing Guidance)
- **Purpose**: Highlight areas of potential risk that require manual inspection
- **Examples**:
  - Pages with forms that need interaction testing
  - PDF/document links that may have accessibility issues
  - Complex widgets requiring keyboard navigation testing
  - Font usage analysis to identify decorative or hard-to-read fonts
  - Interactive elements that automated testing cannot fully evaluate
  - Video content that needs caption verification
- **Impact**: Do NOT count as violations, guide testing priorities

## Changes Made

### 1. Analytics Tracking (`comprehensive_report.py`)
- Added separate counters:
  - `total_violations`: Only errors + warnings
  - `total_info`: Info items count
  - `total_discovery`: Discovery items count
  - `total_issues`: All items (kept for reference)

### 2. Compliance Score Calculation
- **Before**: Used all issues (176 in example)
- **After**: Uses only violations (60 in example)
- **Impact**: More accurate compliance percentage

### 3. Key Metrics Section
- Changed "Total Issues" to "Accessibility Violations"
- Added separate cards for Info and Discovery with explanations
- Added explanatory note about what counts as violations

### 4. Issue Categories Section
- Added subtitles under each category card
- Added comprehensive explanation box describing each category
- Included examples of Discovery items to guide manual testing

### 5. Impact Analysis
- Modified to only analyze impact for violations (errors/warnings)
- Info and Discovery items don't have impact levels

### 6. WCAG Analysis
- Only violations are analyzed for WCAG criteria
- Info and Discovery items don't map to WCAG violations

## User Benefits

1. **Accurate Compliance Scores**: Based only on actual violations
2. **Clear Prioritization**: Understand what must be fixed vs. what to review
3. **Better Resource Allocation**: Focus on real violations first
4. **Guided Manual Testing**: Discovery items show where to focus manual efforts
5. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear distinction between violations and insights

## Example Impact

Using the test site data:
- **Old Count**: 176 "violations" â†’ 0% compliance
- **New Count**: 60 actual violations â†’ More realistic compliance
- **Difference**: 116 items properly categorized as non-violations

This provides a more accurate picture of accessibility status and helps teams focus on what truly needs fixing versus what needs manual review or is simply informational.

## Visual Indicators in Reports

- ðŸ”´ **Errors & Warnings**: Must fix (violations)
- ðŸ”µ **Info**: Good to know (non-violations)
- ðŸŸ£ **Discovery**: Manual review needed (non-violations)

## Testing Files Created

1. `test_info_discovery_fix.py` - Demonstrates the distinction
2. `test_analytics_fix.py` - Shows unique page counting
3. `test_remediation_fix.py` - Shows improved remediation text

All changes work together to provide more accurate, actionable accessibility reporting.
