# WCAG Compliance Level Implementation - Summary

## Overview
Implemented project-specific WCAG compliance level (AA or AAA) testing throughout the accessibility testing tool. Previously, the tool was only testing for AA compliance. Now projects can specify whether they want to test for AA (standard) or AAA (enhanced) compliance levels.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Project Configuration
**Files Modified:**
- `/auto_a11y/web/templates/projects/create.html` - Added WCAG level selector to project creation form
- `/auto_a11y/web/templates/projects/edit.html` - Added WCAG level selector to project edit form  
- `/auto_a11y/web/routes/projects.py` - Updated to handle WCAG level in project config

**Features:**
- Projects now have a `wcag_level` field in their config (defaults to 'AA')
- UI shows clear explanation of each level:
  - **Level AA:** Standard compliance (4.5:1 contrast for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
  - **Level AAA:** Enhanced compliance (7:1 contrast for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text)

### 2. Test Execution
**Files Modified:**
- `/auto_a11y/testing/test_runner.py` - Retrieves project's WCAG level and passes it to JavaScript context

**Implementation:**
- Test runner retrieves WCAG level from project configuration
- Sets `window.WCAG_LEVEL` in browser context before running tests
- Defaults to 'AA' if not specified

### 3. JavaScript Test Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `/auto_a11y/scripts/tests/colorContrast.js` - Updated to check both AA and AAA, return `passesLevel` based on project setting
- `/auto_a11y/scripts/tests/color.js` - Updated to use `passesLevel` instead of hardcoded `isAA`

**Key Changes:**
- Fixed critical bugs where `isAAA` was being overwritten
- Fixed incorrect large text detection logic
- Now properly detects font-weight for bold text determination
- Returns whether text passes the specified WCAG level
- Reports separate error types for normal vs large text failures

### 4. Issue Descriptions
**Files Modified:**
- `/ISSUE_CATALOG_TEMPLATE.md` - Updated contrast error descriptions to include WCAG level
- `/scripts/generate_issue_catalog.py` - Regenerated with new templates
- `/auto_a11y/reporting/issue_descriptions_enhanced.py` - Auto-generated with updated descriptions

**Features:**
- Error descriptions now show which WCAG level was tested
- Descriptions explain the specific thresholds for the tested level
- Metadata includes `wcagLevel`, `passesAA`, `passesAAA` for detailed reporting

## WCAG Contrast Requirements

### Level AA (Standard Compliance)
- **Normal Text:** Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- **Large Text:** Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
  - Large text = ≥24px (18pt) or ≥18.66px (14pt) bold

### Level AAA (Enhanced Compliance)  
- **Normal Text:** Minimum 7:1 contrast ratio
- **Large Text:** Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
  - Large text = ≥24px (18pt) or ≥18.66px (14pt) bold

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility:** Projects can choose their compliance level based on requirements
2. **Accuracy:** Tests now correctly identify passes/failures based on the chosen level
3. **Clarity:** Reports clearly indicate which level was tested and what the requirements are
4. **Correctness:** Fixed multiple bugs in contrast calculation that were causing false failures

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: AA Testing
- Project set to WCAG AA
- Text with 4.69:1 contrast ratio
- Result: **PASS** (meets 4.5:1 requirement)

### Scenario 2: AAA Testing  
- Project set to WCAG AAA
- Same text with 4.69:1 contrast ratio
- Result: **FAIL** (doesn't meet 7:1 requirement)

### Scenario 3: Large Text
- Project set to WCAG AA
- Large text (24px) with 3.5:1 contrast
- Result: **PASS** (meets 3:1 requirement for large text)

## Migration Notes

- Existing projects will default to AA level
- Projects can be edited to change compliance level at any time
- Re-testing with a different level will produce different results

## Testing Verification

Created test files to verify the implementation:
- `test_contrast_logic.html` - HTML page with various contrast scenarios
- `CONTRAST_TESTING_FIX.md` - Documentation of contrast testing fixes
- `WCAG_LEVEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This comprehensive summary

## Impact

This implementation allows organizations to:
1. Test for standard AA compliance (most common requirement)
2. Test for enhanced AAA compliance (for maximum accessibility)
3. Get accurate pass/fail results based on their chosen standard
4. Avoid false positives where content actually meets their requirements
