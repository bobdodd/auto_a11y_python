ID: DiscoFoundInlineSvg
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: svg
Description: Inline SVG element detected that requires manual review to determine appropriate accessibility implementation based on its purpose and complexity
Why it matters: SVG elements serve diverse purposes from simple icons to complex interactive visualizations, each requiring different accessibility approaches. A decorative border needs different treatment than a data chart, which differs from an interactive map or scientific simulation. Automated tools cannot determine SVG purpose, whether it's decorative or informative, static or interactive, or if existing accessibility features adequately support user needs.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need text alternatives for graphics or keyboard access to interactive elements, users with motor disabilities who require keyboard navigation for interactive SVG controls, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clear labeling and predictable interaction patterns.
How to fix: Evaluate the SVG's purpose and complexity - for simple images ensure there is a role="img", use <title> for alt text with aria-labelledby on the SVG referencing an ID on the <title> (a workaround for some browsers), for decorative graphics use aria-hidden="true", for data visualizations provide <title> and <desc> plus consider adjacent detailed text alternatives, for interactive content ensure all controls are keyboard accessible with proper ARIA labels and focus management, for complex simulations provide instructions and state change announcements, and test with screen readers to verify the experience matches visual functionality.

---

---

ID: DiscoFoundSvgImage
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: SVG element with role="img" detected that requires manual review to verify appropriate text alternatives are provided
Why it matters: SVG elements with role="img" are explicitly marked as images and treated as a single graphic by assistive technologies, requiring appropriate text alternatives. While the role="img" indicates developer awareness of accessibility needs, manual review is needed to verify that any aria-label, aria-labelledby, or internal <title> elements adequately describe the image's content or function, and that the description is appropriate for the SVG's context and purpose.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who depend on text alternatives to understand image content.
How to fix: Verify the SVG with role="img" has appropriate accessible names through aria-label or aria-labelledby attributes, ensure any <title> or <desc> elements inside the SVG are properly referenced if used for labeling, confirm decorative SVGs are hidden with aria-hidden="true" rather than given role="img", check that the text alternative accurately describes the SVG's meaning in context, and test with screen readers to ensure the image is announced with meaningful information

---

ID: DiscoNavFound
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: navigation
Description: Navigation region detected (signature: {navSignature}) - requires manual accessibility review
Why it matters: Navigation regions are critical wayfinding tools that must be keyboard accessible, properly labeled, and work with screen readers. Each navigation area needs verification that links are organized logically, focus order is correct, current page indication is provided (aria-current="page"), and the navigation can be easily understood and operated by all users. Multiple navigation regions must be distinguishable via unique accessible names.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks and need clear labels to distinguish navigation regions, keyboard users who must efficiently tab through navigation links, users with motor disabilities who need consistent and predictable navigation patterns, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clear, well-organized navigation structures.
How to fix: Verify navigation has a clear accessible name (aria-label or aria-labelledby) if multiple nav regions exist. Test keyboard navigation through all links (Tab order should be logical). Ensure current page is indicated with aria-current="page". Verify focus indicators are visible. Test with screen reader to confirm navigation is announced correctly and links are understandable out of context.

---

ID: DiscoAsideFound
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Complementary region detected (signature: {asideSignature}) - requires manual accessibility review
Why it matters: Complementary regions (<aside> or role="complementary") provide supporting content related to the main content. They must be properly labeled when multiple exist, contain relevant supplementary information, and be distinguishable from main content for screen reader users who navigate by landmarks.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to find supporting content, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clear content organization and separation of main vs. supplementary information.
How to fix: Verify the aside contains truly complementary content (related to but separate from main content). If multiple complementary regions exist on the page, ensure each has a unique accessible name using aria-label or aria-labelledby. Test with screen reader to confirm the region is announced correctly and its purpose is clear.

---

ID: DiscoSectionFound
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Section region detected (signature: {sectionSignature}) - requires manual accessibility review
Why it matters: Section elements with accessible names become region landmarks (<section> with aria-label/aria-labelledby or role="region"). They must have meaningful, unique labels to help screen reader users navigate between distinct areas of content. Sections without accessible names are not landmarks and won't appear in landmark navigation.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to jump between major page sections, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clearly labeled and organized content regions.
How to fix: Verify each section has a descriptive, unique accessible name (aria-label or aria-labelledby) that clearly identifies its purpose. Ensure the label is concise and meaningful. If the section doesn't represent a significant region of content, consider if it should be a landmark at all. Test with screen reader to confirm the region is announced with its label.

---

ID: DiscoHeaderFound
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Banner region detected (signature: {headerSignature}) - requires manual accessibility review
Why it matters: Banner landmarks (<header> at top level or role="banner") identify the main header of the page, typically containing site logo, main navigation, and site-wide utilities. There should be only one banner per page. It must be properly labeled if the site identity isn't obvious, and should not be nested inside other landmarks (which would prevent it from being a banner).
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly access site-wide navigation and branding, keyboard users who use landmarks for efficient page navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent banner placement for orientation.
How to fix: Verify there is only one banner landmark per page (scoped to top-level <header> or explicit role="banner"). Ensure the banner contains site-level content (logo, main nav, site utilities) rather than page-specific content. If multiple headers exist, ensure only the site-level one is a banner. Test with screen reader to confirm banner is announced correctly.

---

ID: DiscoFooterFound
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Contentinfo region detected (signature: {footerSignature}) - requires manual accessibility review
Why it matters: Contentinfo landmarks (<footer> at top level or role="contentinfo") identify site-wide footer information such as copyright, privacy policy, and contact links. There should be only one contentinfo per page. It must contain site-level information rather than page-specific footers, and should not be nested inside other landmarks (which would prevent it from being contentinfo).
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly access site-wide footer information and legal links, keyboard users who use landmarks for efficient page navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent footer placement for finding important site information.
How to fix: Verify there is only one contentinfo landmark per page (scoped to top-level <footer> or explicit role="contentinfo"). Ensure the footer contains site-level information (copyright, privacy, contact) rather than article-specific or section-specific footers. If multiple footers exist, ensure only the site-level one is contentinfo. Test with screen reader to confirm contentinfo is announced correctly.

---

ID: DiscoSearchFound
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Search region detected (signature: {searchSignature}) - requires manual accessibility review
Why it matters: Search landmarks (<search> or role="search") identify search functionality on the page. They help screen reader users quickly locate search features. The search region must have a clear accessible name if multiple search regions exist, contain appropriate search form controls, and be easily discoverable through landmark navigation.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly find search functionality, keyboard users who use landmarks for efficient page navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clearly marked search areas.
How to fix: Verify the search region contains actual search functionality (typically a form with input and submit button). If multiple search regions exist, ensure each has a unique accessible name using aria-label or aria-labelledby. Ensure search form controls are properly labeled and keyboard accessible. Test with screen reader to confirm search region is announced correctly and search controls are accessible.

---

ID: DiscoHeadingWithID
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: navigation
Description: Heading element has an ID attribute that may be used for in-page navigation
Why it matters: Headings with IDs are often link targets for navigation, requiring verification that they work correctly and provide meaningful navigation points.
Who it affects: All users who use in-page navigation links, screen reader users who navigate by headings, keyboard users who follow fragment links.
How to fix: Ensure that the ID attribute is referenced and its use is valid.

---

ID: DiscoPDFLinksFound
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: pdf
Description: Links to PDF documents detected on page
Why it matters: PDF documents often have accessibility issues and may not be accessible to all users
Who it affects: Screen reader users who have higher cognitive load when reading PDFs
How to fix: Ensure PDFs are accessible (tagged, structured, with text content) or provide HTML alternatives. Ensure that the user knows the link is to a PDF. Ensure the attribute hreflang is provided if the PDF is in a different language to that of the current page and that the language of the PDF is indicated in the link text.

---

ID: DiscoStyleAttrOnElements

---

ID: ErrAltOnElementThatDoesntTakeIt
Type: Error
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Alt attribute placed on HTML elements that don't support it (such as div, span, p, or other non-image elements), making the alternative text inaccessible to assistive technologies
Why it matters: The alt attribute is only valid on specific elements (<img>, <area>, <input type="image">) and is ignored when placed on other elements. Screen readers will not announce this misplaced alt text, meaning any important information it contains is completely lost to users who rely on assistive technologies. This often occurs when developers attempt to add accessibility features but use incorrect techniques.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who cannot access the alternative text content placed in invalid locations, users with cognitive disabilities who may be missing explanatory text, keyboard users who may not receive important contextual information, and users of assistive technologies that rely on proper semantic HTML markup
How to fix: Remove alt attributes from non-supporting elements and use appropriate alternatives - for background images in CSS use role="img" with aria-label, for clickable elements use aria-label or visually hidden text, for decorative elements ensure they're properly hidden with aria-hidden="true", and verify that actual <img> elements are used for content images that need alternative text

---

ID: ErrAltTooLong
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: images
Description: Alt text exceeds 150 characters, making it difficult for screen reader users to process
Why it matters: Excessively long alt text creates a poor listening experience and may indicate that complex information should be presented differently.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who must listen to lengthy descriptions, users with cognitive disabilities who may struggle with verbose content.
How to fix: Limit alt text to 150 characters or less, use longdesc or aria-describedby for complex images, provide detailed descriptions in adjacent text content.

---

ID: ErrAriaLabelMayNotBeFoundByVoiceControl
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.5.3
Touchpoint: aria
Description: aria-label doesn't match visible text
Why it matters: Voice control users can't activate element

---

ID: ErrButtonNoVisibleFocus
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible
Touchpoint: buttons
Description: Button lacks visible focus indicator when focused
Why it matters: Keyboard users need visible focus indicators to know which element is currently selected. Without clear focus indication on buttons, users cannot tell which button will be activated when they press Enter or Space, leading to errors and inability to use the interface effectively.
Who it affects: Users with motor disabilities using keyboard navigation, users who cannot use a mouse, power users who prefer keyboard navigation, and users of assistive technologies
How to fix: Ensure buttons have a clearly visible focus indicator with at least 3:1 contrast against the background. The indicator should be at least 2 pixels thick and not rely on color alone. Never remove focus indicators without providing an alternative. Consider using :focus-visible for refined focus management.

---

ID: ErrButtonTextLowContrast
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
Touchpoint: buttons
Description: Button text has insufficient color contrast with button background
Why it matters: Users with low vision, color blindness, or viewing the page in bright sunlight may not be able to read button labels if contrast is insufficient. This prevents users from understanding button purpose and can make critical functions inaccessible. Buttons are action triggers, so being unable to read them can prevent task completion.
Who it affects: Users with low vision, color blindness, age-related vision changes, and anyone viewing content in poor lighting conditions or on low-quality displays
How to fix: Ensure button text has at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the button background for normal text, or 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold). For Level AAA compliance, use 7:1 for normal text. Test in different states (hover, focus, active) as contrast requirements apply to all states. Avoid using color alone to indicate button state.

---

ID: ErrEmptyHeading
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading element contains only whitespace or special characters: "{text}"
Why it matters: This heading contains only "{text}" which provides no meaningful content. Empty headings disrupt document structure and navigation. Screen reader users rely on headings to understand page organization and navigate efficiently using heading shortcuts. An empty heading creates a navigation point with no information, confusing users about the page structure.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by headings and find a heading containing only "{text}", users with cognitive disabilities who rely on clear structure to understand content organization, and users of assistive technologies that generate page outlines
How to fix: Either replace "{text}" with meaningful text content that describes the section, or remove the empty heading element entirely if it serves no structural purpose. Never use headings for visual spacing - use CSS margin/padding instead.

ID: ErrHtmlLangEmpty
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)
Touchpoint: language
Description: HTML element has a lang attribute present but with no value (lang=""), preventing screen readers from determining the page language
Why it matters: An empty lang attribute is worse than no lang attribute because it explicitly tells assistive technologies there's no language specified, potentially causing screen readers to use incorrect pronunciation rules or fail to switch language synthesizers. This can make content completely unintelligible when read aloud.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need proper language identification for correct pronunciation, multilingual users who rely on automatic language switching in assistive technologies, users with dyslexia using reading tools that depend on language settings, and users of translation services
How to fix: Add a valid language code to the lang attribute (e.g., lang="en" for English, lang="es" for Spanish, lang="fr" for French). Use the correct ISO 639-1 two-letter code or ISO 639-2 three-letter code. For the HTML element, always specify the primary document language. If the language is truly unknown, remove the lang attribute entirely rather than leaving it empty.

ID: ErrIframeWithNoTitleAttr
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks, 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
Touchpoint: title
Description: Iframe element is missing the required title attribute
Why it matters: Iframes embed external content like videos, maps, or forms within your page. Without a title attribute, screen reader users hear only "iframe" with no indication of what content it contains. This is like having a door with no label - users don't know what's behind it. They must enter the iframe and explore its content to understand its purpose, which is time-consuming and may be confusing if the iframe content lacks context. For pages with multiple iframes, users cannot distinguish between them or decide which ones are worth exploring.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need to understand what each iframe contains before deciding whether to interact with it, keyboard users navigating through iframes who need context about embedded content, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling of all page regions, and users on slow connections who may experience delays loading iframe content
How to fix: Add a title attribute to every iframe that concisely describes its content or purpose (e.g., title="YouTube video: Product demonstration", title="Google Maps: Office location", title="Payment form"). The title should be unique if there are multiple iframes. Keep it brief but descriptive enough that users understand what the iframe contains without having to enter it. For decorative iframes (rare), you can use title="" and add tabindex="-1" to remove it from tab order.

ID: ErrImageAltContainsHTML
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Image's alternative text contains HTML markup tags
Why it matters: HTML in alt text is not parsed, so screen readers will read the HTML markup as literal characters. Users will hear angle brackets announced as "less than" or "greater than" and tag names spelled out, creating a confusing experience. For example, alt="<b>Team Photo</b>" would be read as "less than b greater than Team Photo less than slash b greater than".
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who will hear nonsense characters and words interspersed with the actual alt text, making it difficult or impossible to understand the image content
How to fix: Remove all HTML markup from alt attributes and use only plain text. If formatting or structure is important to convey, describe it in words rather than using markup (e.g., instead of "<em>Important</em>" use "Important, emphasized").

---

ID: ErrImageWithEmptyAlt
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Image alt attribute contains only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, line breaks), providing no accessible name
Why it matters: Whitespace-only alt attributes fail to provide any accessible name for the image, causing screen readers to announce unhelpful fallback information like the image filename or "unlabeled graphic". Unlike properly empty alt="" which signals decorative content, whitespace alt text creates ambiguity - users cannot determine if they're missing important information or if the image is decorative.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users relying on screen readers who cannot determine the image's purpose or content, users with cognitive disabilities who depend on clear labeling to understand page content, and users of voice control software who cannot reference images without accessible names
How to fix: Determine the image's purpose and apply appropriate alt text - for informative images add descriptive alternative text that conveys the same information, for decorative images use alt="" (no spaces) to properly mark them as decorative, for functional images describe the action or destination not the appearance, and remove any whitespace-only alt attributes that serve as ineffective placeholders

---

ID: ErrImageWithImgFileExtensionAlt
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Alt text contains image filename with file extension (e.g., "photo.jpg", "IMG_1234.png", "banner.gif"), providing no meaningful description of the image content
Why it matters: Filenames rarely describe image content meaningfully and often contain technical identifiers, underscores, hyphens, or numbers that create a poor listening experience when announced by screen readers. Users hear cryptic strings like "DSC underscore zero zero four two dot jay peg" instead of learning what the image actually shows, forcing them to guess at important visual information or miss it entirely.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need meaningful descriptions to understand visual content, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on clear, descriptive text to process information, users in low-bandwidth situations where images don't load and only alt text is displayed, and search engine users who rely on descriptive alt text for finding relevant content
How to fix: Replace the filename with descriptive text that conveys the image's information or purpose (change alt="hero-banner-2.jpg" to alt="Students collaborating in the campus library"), focus on what the image communicates rather than technical details, ensure the description makes sense when read in context with surrounding content, and avoid including file extensions or technical metadata in alt attributes

---

ID: ErrImageWithNoAlt
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Images are missing alternative text attributes, preventing assistive technologies from conveying their content or purpose to users
Why it matters: Screen readers cannot describe image content to users who are blind or have low vision, creating information barriers that may prevent understanding of essential content, navigation, or task completion. This also affects users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from text alternatives and users on slow connections where images fail to load.
Who it affects: Blind users using screen readers, users with low vision using screen readers with magnification, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on text alternatives, voice control users who need text labels to reference elements, and users on slow internet connections
How to fix: Add descriptive alt attributes for informative images (alt="Sales chart showing 40% increase"), use empty alt attributes for decorative images (alt=""), describe the function for interactive images (alt="Search" not alt="magnifying glass icon"), and provide detailed descriptions via aria-describedby for complex images like charts or diagrams.

---

ID: ErrImageWithURLAsAlt
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Alt attribute contains a URL (starting with http://, https://, www., or file://) instead of descriptive text about the image content
Why it matters: URLs provide no meaningful information about what an image shows or its purpose on the page. Screen reader users hear lengthy, difficult-to-parse web addresses being spelled out character by character or in chunks like "h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash-w-w-w-dot", creating a frustrating experience that conveys nothing about the actual image content. This often happens when image source URLs are mistakenly copied into alt attributes.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need meaningful descriptions instead of technical URLs, users with cognitive disabilities who cannot process or remember long URL strings to understand image content, users in low-bandwidth situations where only alt text displays when images fail to load, and voice control users who cannot effectively reference images labeled with URLs
How to fix: Replace the URL with descriptive text that conveys what the image shows or its function (change alt="https://example.com/images/team-photo.jpg" to alt="Marketing team at annual conference"), focus on describing the image content rather than its location or technical details, ensure the description makes sense in the page context, and never use the image's web address as its alternative text

Description: Title attribute used improperly as primary labeling mechanism
Why it matters: Title attributes are not reliably announced by all assistive technologies and should not be the only way to provide essential information.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not receive title attribute content, mobile users who cannot hover to see tooltips.
How to fix: Use proper labeling techniques (label elements, aria-label) instead of relying on title attributes for essential information.

---

ID: ErrInappropriateMenuRole
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)

Description: Menu role used inappropriately for navigation links
Why it matters: Menu role is for application menus, not navigation. Misuse causes incorrect keyboard behavior and screen reader announcements.
Who it affects: Screen reader users expecting application menu behavior, keyboard users expecting arrow key navigation.
How to fix: Use nav element or role="navigation" for site navigation, reserve role="menu" for actual application menus with proper ARIA patterns.

---

ID: ErrIncorrectHeadingLevel
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading level used incorrectly based on visual appearance rather than document structure
Why it matters: Incorrect heading levels break the document outline and make it difficult to understand content hierarchy.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by headings, users who rely on proper document structure.
How to fix: Use heading levels to convey document structure (h1 > h2 > h3), not for visual styling; use CSS for appearance.

ID: ErrInvalidGenericLinkName
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link text is generic and provides no information about destination
Why it matters: Generic link text like "click here" provides no context when links are reviewed out of context.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by links, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear link purposes.
How to fix: Use descriptive link text that explains the destination or action, avoid generic phrases like "click here" or "read more".

---

ID: ErrInvalidLanguageCode
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A), 3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA)
Touchpoint: language
Description: Language attribute contains invalid code '{found}' that doesn't conform to ISO 639 standards
Why it matters: The language code '{found}' is not recognized as a valid ISO 639 language code. This prevents assistive technologies from properly processing content, causing screen readers to mispronounce words, use incorrect inflection patterns, or fail to switch language engines. This can make content difficult or impossible to understand when read aloud, especially if the content is in a non-English language but gets read with English pronunciation rules.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users relying on screen readers for accurate pronunciation, multilingual users who need proper language identification for comprehension, users with reading disabilities using text-to-speech tools, and international users accessing content in multiple languages
How to fix: Replace '{found}' with a valid ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 language code. If '{found}' appears to be English, use "en". Common corrections: "english" → "en", "spanish" → "es", "french" → "fr", "deutsch" → "de", "eng" → "en". For regional variants use BCP 47 format (e.g., "en-US", "en-GB", "es-MX"). Check the official ISO 639 registry for the correct code.

ID: ErrInvalidTabindex
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Element has a tabindex attribute with an invalid value (non-numeric or decimal)
Why it matters: Invalid tabindex values are ignored by browsers, potentially making interactive elements unreachable by keyboard or creating unpredictable focus behavior. This can completely block keyboard users from accessing functionality. The element might be skipped during tabbing, receive focus unexpectedly, or behave differently across browsers.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who cannot reach or interact with the element, screen reader users who may miss important interactive controls, users with motor disabilities relying on keyboard navigation, and users who cannot use a mouse
How to fix: Use only valid integer values for tabindex: "0" to include in natural tab order, "-1" to remove from tab order but allow programmatic focus, or remove the tabindex attribute entirely if the element shouldn't be focusable. Never use decimal values (1.5), text ("first"), or empty values (tabindex="").

ID: ErrLabelContainsMultipleFields
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 3.3.2
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Single label contains {count} form fields
Why it matters: A label containing {count} fields creates ambiguity about which field it describes. Screen readers will associate this label with all {count} fields, making it unclear which field is which.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need clear field identification, users with cognitive disabilities who need simple relationships
How to fix: Split the label so each of the {count} fields has its own dedicated label. Use fieldset and legend for grouped fields if they're related.

ID: ErrLargeTextContrastAA
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Large text fails WCAG AA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This large text ({fontSize}px) with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AA requirements. Large text (24px+ or 18.66px+ bold) requires a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 to pass Level AA. The foreground color ({fg}) against background ({bg}) doesn't provide enough distinction.
Who it affects: Users with low vision, color blindness, or age-related vision changes who struggle to distinguish text with insufficient contrast, even when the text is larger
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AA requires at least 3:1 for large text. To fix, adjust the foreground color from {fg} or the background from {bg}. Consider using #949494 or darker on white background for large text.

---

ID: ErrLargeTextContrastAAA
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Large text fails WCAG AAA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This large text ({fontSize}px) with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AAA enhanced requirements. Large text (24px+ or 18.66px+ bold) requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to pass Level AAA for enhanced accessibility.
Who it affects: Users with moderate visual impairments who benefit from enhanced contrast even for large text, ensuring optimal readability in all conditions
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AAA requires at least 4.5:1 for large text. To fix, adjust colors to achieve higher contrast, such as #767676 or darker on white background for large text at Level AAA.

ID: ErrLinkOpensNewWindowNoWarning
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 3.2.2 On Input
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link opens in new window/tab without warning users
Why it matters: Unexpectedly opening new windows can disorient users, especially those using screen readers or magnification. Users may not realize a new window opened and become confused when the back button doesn't work. This is particularly problematic for users with cognitive disabilities or those unfamiliar with browser behaviors.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not notice the context change, users with cognitive disabilities who may become disoriented, users with motor disabilities who have difficulty managing multiple windows, and novice computer users
How to fix: Add visible text or an icon indicating the link opens in a new window. Include this information in the accessible name (e.g., "Annual report (opens in new window)"). Consider whether opening in a new window is necessary - often it's better to open in the same window and let users control this behavior.

ID: ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link text does not adequately describe the link's destination or purpose
Why it matters: Users need to understand where a link will take them before activating it. Vague link text like "click here" or "read more" provides no information about the destination. Screen reader users often navigate by pulling up a list of all links, where non-descriptive text becomes meaningless out of context.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by links list, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear navigation cues, and users with motor disabilities who need to make informed decisions before activating links
How to fix: Write link text that describes the destination or action (e.g., "Download 2024 annual report" instead of "Download"). Avoid generic phrases. If design constraints require short link text, provide additional context through aria-label or aria-describedby, or ensure surrounding text provides context.

ID: ErrMultipleH1
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Page contains {count} h1 elements instead of just one
Why it matters: Having {count} h1 elements creates confusion about the page's main topic. Each h1 represents a primary heading, and multiple h1s suggest multiple main topics, breaking the document hierarchy. Screen readers users won't know which h1 represents the actual page topic.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who expect a single h1 to identify the page topic, users navigating by headings who see multiple "top level" items, SEO and search engines that look for a single main topic
How to fix: Keep only one h1 that represents the main page topic. Change the other h1 elements to h2 or appropriate lower levels based on their relationship to the main topic.

---

ID: ErrMultipleMainLandmarks
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Multiple main landmark regions found on the page
Why it matters: The main landmark should contain THE primary content of the page - having multiple main landmarks is like having multiple "Chapter 1" sections in a book. It confuses the page structure and defeats the purpose of landmarks. Screen reader users expecting to jump to the main content won't know which landmark contains the actual primary content. They might land in the wrong section, miss important content, or have to check multiple "main" areas. This ambiguity makes the landmark system unreliable and forces users back to linear navigation.
Who it affects: Screen reader users relying on the main landmark to skip to primary content, keyboard users using landmark navigation extensions, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear, unambiguous page structure, and developers trying to understand the intended page structure
How to fix: Use only one <main> element or role="main" per page. Identify which content is truly the primary, unique content for that page and wrap only that in the main landmark. If you have multiple important sections, use other appropriate landmarks (article, section) or headings to structure them within the single main landmark. The main should contain all unique page content but exclude repeated elements like headers, navigation, and footers.

ID: ErrNoBannerLandmarkOnPage
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a banner landmark to identify the site header region
Why it matters: The banner landmark identifies the site header which typically contains the site logo, main navigation, and search functionality. This content appears consistently across pages and users expect to find it at the top. Without proper banner markup, screen reader users cannot quickly jump to the header area using landmark navigation shortcuts. They must instead navigate through all content linearly or guess where the header content begins and ends. This makes it difficult to access primary navigation or return to the site homepage via the logo link, tasks that sighted users can do instantly by looking at the top of the page.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who use landmark navigation to quickly access site navigation and branding, keyboard users who want to efficiently navigate to header elements, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure to orient themselves, and users with low vision using screen magnifiers who need to quickly locate navigation elements
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <header> element for your site header (it has an implicit role of banner when it's not nested inside article, aside, main, nav, or section elements). Alternatively, add role="banner" to the container holding your header content. There should typically be only one banner landmark per page at the top level. Include site-wide content like logo, primary navigation, and site search within the banner landmark.

ID: ErrNoFocusIndicator
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Interactive element has no visible focus indicator when focused, making keyboard navigation impossible to track
Why it matters: Focus indicators show keyboard users where they are on the page - without them, it's like navigating in the dark. Users cannot see which element will be activated when they press Enter or Space, making it impossible to navigate confidently. They might activate the wrong control, skip important content, or become completely lost on the page. This is especially critical for forms where activating the wrong button could submit incomplete data or cancel an operation.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who need to see their current position, users with attention or memory disabilities who lose track of focus position, users with low vision who need clear visual indicators, users with motor disabilities who need to carefully track navigation, and any user who temporarily cannot use a mouse
How to fix: Ensure all interactive elements have a visible focus indicator using CSS :focus styles. Add outline, border, background color, or box-shadow changes. Make focus indicators clearly visible with sufficient color contrast (3:1 minimum). Never use outline: none without providing an alternative indicator. Consider using :focus-visible for keyboard-only focus styles. Test by tabbing through your entire page to ensure every interactive element shows focus clearly.

Touchpoint: headings
Description: Page has no h1 heading
Why it matters: H1 headings identify the main topic of a page and are crucial for document structure.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by headings, users who rely on document outlines.
How to fix: Add exactly one h1 heading that describes the main content or purpose of the page.

---

ID: ErrNoHeadingsOnPage
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: No heading elements (h1-h6) found anywhere on the page
Why it matters: Headings create the structural outline of your content, like a table of contents. They allow users to understand how information is organized and navigate directly to sections of interest. Without any headings, screen reader users cannot use heading navigation shortcuts (one of their primary navigation methods) and must read through all content linearly. This is like forcing someone to read an entire book without chapter titles or section breaks. Users cannot skim content, jump to relevant sections, or understand the information hierarchy. For users with cognitive disabilities, the lack of visual structure makes content overwhelming and hard to process.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who lose a critical navigation method and cannot understand content structure, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear visual organization to process information, users with attention disorders who rely on headings to focus on relevant sections, and users with reading disabilities who use headings to break content into manageable chunks
How to fix: Add semantic heading elements (h1-h6) to structure your content. Start with one h1 that describes the main page topic. Use h2 for major sections, h3 for subsections, and so on. Don't skip levels (e.g., h1 to h3). Ensure headings describe the content that follows them. Never use headings just for visual styling - they must represent actual content structure. If you need large text without semantic meaning, use CSS instead.

ID: ErrNoMainLandmark
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a main landmark region to identify the primary content area
Why it matters: Screen reader users rely on landmarks to understand page layout and quickly navigate to important sections. The main landmark allows users to skip repeated content like headers and navigation to jump directly to the unique page content. Without it, users must navigate through all repeated elements on every page, which is time-consuming and frustrating. The main landmark should contain all content that is unique to the page, including the h1 heading.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who navigate by landmarks, users with motor disabilities who need efficient keyboard navigation to skip repeated content, and users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clear page structure
How to fix: Add a <main> element around the primary content area, or use role="main" on an appropriate container element. Ensure there is only one main landmark per page, position it as a top-level landmark (not nested inside other landmarks), and include all unique page content within it, including the h1 heading. The main landmark should not include repeated content like site headers, navigation, or footers.

ID: ErrNoPageLanguage
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)
Touchpoint: language
Description: HTML element is missing the lang attribute, preventing assistive technologies from determining the primary language of the page
Why it matters: Without a declared language, screen readers cannot determine which pronunciation rules and voice synthesizer to use, often defaulting to the user's system language which may be incorrect. This causes mispronunciation, incorrect inflection, and can make content unintelligible, especially for pages in languages different from the user's default settings.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need correct pronunciation for comprehension, international users accessing content in different languages, users with dyslexia or reading disabilities using assistive reading tools, and users of automatic translation services
How to fix: Add the lang attribute to the <html> element with the appropriate language code (e.g., <html lang="en"> for English, <html lang="fr"> for French). Use ISO 639-1 two-letter codes for modern languages. For XHTML, also include xml:lang with the same value. Ensure the declared language matches the actual primary language of your content. For multilingual pages, use the language that represents the majority of the content.

---

ID: ErrNoPageTitle
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled
Touchpoint: page
Description: Page has no <title> element in the document head
Why it matters: The page title is the first thing screen reader users hear when a page loads, and it appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and search results. Without a title, users cannot identify the page in their browser history, distinguish between multiple open tabs, or understand what page they're on when arriving from a link. Screen reader users announcing "Untitled document" have no context about where they are. This is like opening a book with no title on the cover or spine - you don't know what you're reading until you dive into the content. The title is critical for orientation and navigation.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who rely on titles for page identification and orientation, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear page identification, users managing multiple browser tabs who need to distinguish between pages, users with memory issues using browser history to return to pages, and all users when bookmarking or sharing pages
How to fix: Add a <title> element within the <head> section of your HTML. Create descriptive, unique titles that identify both the page content and the site. Use a consistent pattern like "Page Topic - Site Name". Put the unique page information first since it's most important. Keep titles concise (under 60 characters) but descriptive. Avoid generic titles like "Home" or "Page 1". The title should make sense when read out of context in a list of bookmarks or search results.

---

ID: ErrOutlineIsNoneOnInteractiveElement
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Interactive element has CSS outline:none removing the default focus indicator
Why it matters: People with mobility disabilities use keyboard or keyboard-alternate devices to navigate rather than a mouse. Visible focus indicators are essential as they perform the same function as a mouse cursor. Without focus indicators, users cannot tell where they are on the page or when interactive elements are focused. This makes keyboard navigation impossible and can completely prevent access to functionality.
Who it affects: Sighted users with motor disabilities navigating with keyboard or keyboard-alternate devices, users who prefer keyboard navigation for efficiency, users with temporary injuries preventing mouse use, and users of assistive technologies that rely on keyboard navigation
How to fix: Never use outline:none without providing an alternative visible focus indicator. The focus indicator must be clearly visible with at least 3:1 contrast ratio with the background, be at least 2 pixels thick, and ideally be offset from the element to maximize visibility. Consider using CSS :focus-visible for better control over when focus indicators appear.

---

WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Placeholder attribute used as the only label for form field
Why it matters: Placeholder text disappears when users start typing, leaving no persistent label for reference.
Who it affects: Users with cognitive disabilities, users who need to review form data, screen reader users.
How to fix: Add proper label elements or aria-label, use placeholder only for supplementary hints or examples.

---

ID: ErrPositiveTabindex
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.3 Focus Order
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Element uses a positive tabindex value (greater than 0)
Why it matters: Positive tabindex values override the natural tab order of the page, creating an unpredictable navigation experience. When you use tabindex="1" or higher, that element jumps to the front of the tab order, regardless of where it appears visually. This breaks the expected top-to-bottom, left-to-right flow that keyboard users rely on. Users might tab from the header straight to a random form field in the middle of the page, then jump to the footer, then back to the navigation. This confusing order makes it easy to miss content, difficult to predict where focus will go next, and nearly impossible to maintain as the page evolves.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who expect logical, predictable navigation order, screen reader users who rely on consistent focus flow, users with motor disabilities who need efficient keyboard navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who are confused by unpredictable focus movement, and developers maintaining the code who must manage complex tabindex values
How to fix: Remove positive tabindex values and use only tabindex="0" (adds element to natural tab order) or tabindex="-1" (removes from tab order but allows programmatic focus). Let the DOM order determine tab order - if elements need to be reached in a different order, rearrange them in the HTML. If visual order must differ from DOM order for design reasons, consider using CSS Grid or Flexbox with the order property, but be cautious as this can still cause accessibility issues.

ID: ErrHeadingOrder
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Headings appear in illogical order - high-level headings (H1, H2) appear after lower-level headings (H3, H4, H5, H6)
Why it matters: Document structure should be logical and predictable. When high-level headings like H1 or H2 appear after lower-level headings, it creates a backwards or inverted hierarchy. This is like reading a book where chapter titles appear after section headings, or where the main title appears at the end. Screen reader users navigating by headings expect the most important headings first, followed by progressively more detailed subsections. When headings appear out of logical order, users cannot understand the content structure, may miss important navigation landmarks, and cannot build an accurate mental model of how the page is organized.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who rely on heading navigation and expect logical document structure, users with cognitive disabilities who need predictable content organization, users who generate document outlines from headings, and users who navigate by heading levels to understand content hierarchy
How to fix: Restructure your content so that high-level headings (H1, H2) appear before lower-level headings. Start with H1 for the main page title, then H2 for major sections, then H3 for subsections within those. Headings should appear in a logical, top-down hierarchy that matches how users would naturally read and understand the content structure.

ID: ErrSkippedHeadingLevel
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading levels are not in sequential order - jumped from h{skippedFrom} to h{skippedTo}, skipping intermediate level(s)
Why it matters: Heading levels create a hierarchical outline of your content, like nested bullet points. Jumping from h{skippedFrom} to h{skippedTo} breaks this logical structure. It's like having chapter {skippedFrom}, then jumping to section {skippedTo} without the intermediate section. Screen reader users navigating by headings will be confused about the relationship between sections - is the h{skippedTo} a subsection of something that's missing? This broken hierarchy makes it hard to understand how content is organized and can cause users to think content is missing or that they've accidentally skipped something.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by heading structure who rely on levels to understand content relationships, users with cognitive disabilities who need logical, predictable content organization, users of assistive technology that generates document outlines, and developers or content authors maintaining the page who need to understand the intended structure
How to fix: Insert an h{expectedLevel} heading between the h{skippedFrom} and h{skippedTo}, or change the h{skippedTo} to h{expectedLevel} to maintain sequential order. After h{skippedFrom}, use h{expectedLevel} for the next level. Don't skip levels when going down the hierarchy. If you need a heading to look smaller visually, use CSS to style it rather than choosing a lower heading level. The heading level should reflect the content's logical structure, not its visual appearance.

ID: ErrSmallText
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.4.4 Resize text (Level AA)
Touchpoint: typography
Description: Text is too small to read comfortably (less than 12px)
Why it matters: Small text is difficult to read, especially for users with low vision or on mobile devices.
Who it affects: Users with low vision, aging users, mobile device users, users with reading disabilities.
How to fix: Use minimum 14px (preferably 16px) for body text, ensure text can be zoomed to 200% without loss of functionality.

ID: ErrSvgImageNoLabel
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: SVG image element lacks accessible text alternatives, making it invisible to screen reader users
Why it matters: SVG images without proper labeling are completely inaccessible to screen reader users - they are either skipped entirely or announced as "graphic" with no indication of what they represent. Unlike HTML img elements that can use alt attributes, SVGs require different techniques for accessibility. Without proper labeling, users miss important visual information, icons, charts, logos, or interactive graphics that may be essential for understanding or using the page.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who cannot perceive any information about unlabeled SVG content, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from text descriptions of complex graphics, keyboard users who may encounter interactive SVGs without understanding their purpose, and users of assistive technologies that need text alternatives for all visual content
How to fix: For simple SVGs, add role="img" and aria-label with descriptive text. For complex SVGs, use <title> as the first child element and reference it with aria-labelledby. For decorative SVGs, use aria-hidden="true" to hide from assistive technologies. For inline SVGs containing text, ensure text is in actual text elements not paths. For interactive SVGs, provide appropriate ARIA labels for all interactive elements. Always test with screen readers to verify SVGs are properly announced.

ID: ErrTextContrastAA
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Text fails WCAG AA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This text with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AA requirements. Normal text requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to pass Level AA. The foreground color ({fg}) against the background ({bg}) doesn't provide enough distinction for users with visual impairments.
Who it affects: Users with low vision who need higher contrast to distinguish text, users with color blindness, older users experiencing age-related vision changes, and users viewing content in bright sunlight or on low-quality displays
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AA requires at least 4.5:1 for normal text ({fontSize}px). To fix, darken the foreground color from {fg} or lighten the background from {bg}. Consider using #595959 or darker on white background, or #FFFFFF on backgrounds darker than #767676.

Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Text fails WCAG AAA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This text with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AAA enhanced requirements. Normal text requires a minimum contrast ratio of 7:1 to pass Level AAA. The foreground color ({fg}) against the background ({bg}) doesn't provide optimal distinction for maximum accessibility.
Who it affects: Users with moderate visual impairments, including those with low vision, color blindness, or contrast sensitivity who benefit from enhanced contrast for optimal readability
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AAA requires at least 7:1 for normal text ({fontSize}px). To fix, use high contrast combinations like #333333 or darker on white background, or white text on backgrounds darker than #565656.

Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A), 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form element is using title attribute as its only accessible label, which is insufficient for accessibility
Why it matters: When title is the only labeling mechanism for a form field, many users cannot determine what information to enter. Title attributes are not announced by screen readers when navigating forms in normal mode, don't appear on mobile devices, cannot be accessed by keyboard users, and disappear too quickly for many users to read. This makes the form field essentially unlabeled for a large portion of users, preventing them from completing forms successfully.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who won't hear the field's purpose when navigating the form, mobile users who cannot see title tooltips at all, keyboard users who cannot hover to see the tooltip, users with motor disabilities who struggle with precise hovering, users with cognitive disabilities who need persistent labels as memory aids, and voice control users who cannot reference fields without visible labels
How to fix: Add a proper visible <label> element associated with the form field using the 'for' attribute. If space is limited, use placeholder text in addition to (not instead of) a label. For complex layouts, consider using aria-labelledby to reference existing visible text. If you must use aria-label, ensure it's descriptive and consider adding visible text for sighted users. Never rely solely on title attributes for labeling form fields - they should only supplement proper labels, not replace them.

ID: ErrTitleAttrFound
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 5.2.4 Accessible Documentation (Conformance Requirement), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Title attribute used - fundamentally inaccessible to assistive technology
Why it matters: Title attributes fail WCAG Conformance requirement 5.2.4 as they are not accessible with regular assistive technology. For screen magnifier users at high magnification, tooltip content extends off-screen and disappears when mouse moves to read it, making content completely inaccessible. Additionally, title attributes are not accessible on mobile/touch devices, inconsistently announced by screen readers, and cannot be accessed by keyboard-only users
Who it affects: Screen magnifier users (tooltip goes off-screen at high magnification), mobile and touch screen users (no hover), keyboard-only users (cannot trigger tooltip), screen reader users (inconsistent support), users with motor disabilities (tooltip disappears when mouse moves), users with cognitive disabilities (tooltip disappears too quickly)
How to fix: Never use title attributes. Use visible text, proper <label> elements for forms, aria-label for icons, or visible helper text. For abbreviations, provide full text on first use or use <dfn> element

---

ID: ErrTransparentFocusIndicator
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Focus indicator uses transparent or nearly transparent color, making it effectively invisible
Why it matters: A transparent focus indicator is functionally the same as no focus indicator - users cannot see where keyboard focus is located. This might occur from using rgba with 0 or very low alpha values, setting outline-color to transparent, or using colors that match the background. The focus indicator exists technically but provides no practical benefit to users trying to navigate.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who need visible focus indicators to navigate, users with low vision who need clear visual cues, users with color blindness who may already struggle with certain color combinations, and users with cognitive disabilities who need obvious focus indicators
How to fix: Use opaque colors with sufficient contrast for focus indicators. Replace transparent outlines with visible colors, ensure at least 3:1 contrast ratio between focus indicator and background, use solid colors or high alpha values (0.7 or higher) for rgba colors. Test focus indicators on different backgrounds across your site. Consider using box-shadow or background changes as additional focus indicators.

ID: ErrUnlabelledField
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form input element lacks an accessible name through <label>, aria-label, aria-labelledby, or other labeling methods, leaving the field's purpose undefined for assistive technologies
Why it matters: Without labels, users cannot determine what information to enter, leading to form errors, abandoned transactions, and inability to complete critical tasks. Screen readers announce only the field type like "edit" or "combo box" without context, forcing users to guess based on surrounding content that may not be programmatically associated. This creates barriers for independent form completion and may result in users submitting incorrect information or being unable to proceed.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who hear no field description when navigating forms, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels to understand what information is required, users with motor disabilities using voice control who cannot reference unlabeled fields by name, mobile users where placeholder text may disappear on focus, and users who rely on browser autofill features that depend on proper field labeling
How to fix: Add explicit <label> elements with for attribute matching the input's id (preferred method), use aria-label for simple labels when visual text isn't needed, implement aria-labelledby to reference existing visible text, ensure placeholder text is not the only labeling method as it disappears on input, wrap inputs and label text together for implicit association, and verify all form controls including select elements, textareas, and custom widgets have accessible names

ID: InfoFieldLabelledUsingAriaLabel
Type: Info
Impact: N/A
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Field is labeled using aria-label="{found}", which is valid but may have usability considerations
Why it matters: While aria-label="{found}" is a valid way to label this form field, it has limitations: the label "{found}" is not visible on screen which can confuse sighted users, voice control users cannot reference the field by the visible text "{found}", the label won't be automatically translated by browser translation tools, and users with cognitive disabilities benefit from visible labels as memory aids.
Who it affects: Sighted users who can't see "{found}" as a label, voice control users who can't say "click {found}", users relying on browser translation, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from persistent visible labels
How to fix: Consider if a visible label showing "{found}" would better serve all users. If space permits, use a visible <label> element with the text "{found}". If aria-label must be used, ensure "{found}" is clear and descriptive. Consider adding visible helper text or placeholder text to provide visual context.

ID: WarnButtonGenericText
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: buttons
Description: Button uses generic text like "Click here", "Submit", or "OK" without context
Why it matters: Screen reader users often navigate by pulling up a list of all buttons on a page. Generic button text provides no information about what the button does when heard out of context. Users cannot determine the button's purpose without additional exploration, slowing navigation and potentially causing errors.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by buttons list, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels, and screen magnifier users who may not see surrounding context
How to fix: Use descriptive button text that explains the action (e.g., "Submit registration form" instead of "Submit", "Download PDF report" instead of "Download"). The button text should make sense when read in isolation. If visual design constraints require short text, use aria-label to provide a more descriptive accessible name.

Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum), 1.4.8 Visual Presentation
Touchpoint: color
Description: Color-related CSS properties found in inline style attributes on HTML elements
Why it matters: Inline color styles bypass user stylesheets and browser extensions that help users with visual disabilities customize colors for better readability. Users who need high contrast, inverted colors, or specific color schemes cannot easily override inline styles. This also makes it difficult to implement dark mode, maintain consistent theming, or allow user color preferences.
Who it affects: Users with low vision who need high contrast or specific color combinations, users with color blindness who need to adjust problematic color pairs, users with dyslexia who benefit from specific background colors, users with light sensitivity who need dark themes, and users who rely on browser extensions for color customization
How to fix: Move color-related styles (color, background-color, border-color, etc.) to external CSS files using classes. This allows users to override styles with their own stylesheets, enables easier theme switching, improves maintainability, and supports user preference media queries like prefers-color-scheme. Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors to make customization even easier.

ID: WarnColorRelatedStyleDefinedExplicitlyInStyleTag
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum), 1.4.8 Visual Presentation
Touchpoint: color
Description: Color-related CSS found in <style> tags within the HTML document instead of external stylesheets
Why it matters: Embedded styles in <style> tags are harder for users to override than external stylesheets and may not be cached efficiently. Users with visual disabilities who need custom color schemes must use more aggressive CSS overrides. This approach also makes it difficult to maintain consistent theming across pages and prevents users from disabling styles entirely if needed.
Who it affects: Users with low vision requiring custom color schemes, users with photosensitivity needing to modify bright colors, users with color blindness who need to adjust color combinations, and users who benefit from consistent, predictable styling across pages
How to fix: Move color styles to external CSS files linked with <link> tags. Organize colors using CSS custom properties for easy theming. Implement user preference support with @media (prefers-color-scheme) and similar queries. Consider providing theme switcher functionality. Ensure your external stylesheets are properly cached for performance.

Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Important content found outside of any landmark region, making it harder for screen reader users to find and navigate to
Why it matters: Landmarks create a navigable structure for your page, like a table of contents. Content outside landmarks is like having chapters missing from the table of contents - users may never find it when navigating by landmarks. Screen reader users often jump between landmarks to quickly scan page structure, and content outside landmarks requires them to read through the entire page linearly to discover it. This particularly affects users who are familiar with your site and want to quickly navigate to specific content areas.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to efficiently explore pages, keyboard users using browser extensions for landmark navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and power users who use landmarks for quick navigation
How to fix: Ensure all meaningful content is contained within appropriate landmark regions. Typically: use <header> or role="banner" for site headers, <nav> or role="navigation" for navigation menus, <main> or role="main" for primary content, <aside> or role="complementary" for sidebar content, <footer> or role="contentinfo" for footers. Decorative content or spacers can remain outside landmarks. Review your page structure to ensure no important content is orphaned outside the landmark structure.

Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA)
Touchpoint: language
Description: Element (non-HTML) has a lang attribute present but with no value (lang=""), preventing screen readers from determining language changes
Why it matters: An empty lang attribute on elements prevents screen readers from properly switching pronunciation rules for content in different languages. Screen readers cannot adjust pronunciation rules for content sections in different languages. This can make multilingual content difficult or impossible to understand when read aloud.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need proper language identification for correct pronunciation, multilingual users relying on language switching, users of translation tools, and users with reading disabilities using text-to-speech
How to fix: Add a valid language code to the lang attribute (e.g., lang="fr" for French, lang="es" for Spanish). Use the correct ISO 639-1 two-letter code or ISO 639-2 three-letter code. If the language matches the page language, remove the lang attribute entirely rather than leaving it empty.

ID: WarnFieldLabelledByElementThatIsNotALabel
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 3.3.2
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Field labeled by element '{found}' that is not semantically a label
Why it matters: The element with ID '{found}' is being used as a label but is not a <label> element. While this can work, non-label elements may not convey proper semantic meaning or behave as users expect.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not receive proper label semantics
How to fix: Consider using a proper <label> element, or ensure the element '{found}' contains appropriate descriptive text for the field

---

ID: WarnFieldLabelledByMultipleElements
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 3.3.2
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Field is labeled by {count} elements via aria-labelledby
Why it matters: When {count} elements label a field, they will be concatenated together. The order and combination may not make sense or could be confusing when read as a single label.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who hear all {count} labels concatenated together
How to fix: Review the {count} labeling elements to ensure they make sense when read together in order. Consider if a single, clear label would be better.

Description: Font not in recommended accessibility list
Why it matters: Some fonts are harder to read
Who it affects: Users with dyslexia, low vision
How to fix: Use clear, simple fonts like Arial, Verdana

---

ID: WarnFontsizeIsBelow16px
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.4.4
Touchpoint: fonts
Description: Font size is {fontSize}px, below recommended 16px minimum
Why it matters: Text at {fontSize}px is harder to read than the recommended minimum of 16px. Small text requires more effort to read and can cause eye strain, especially for extended reading.
Who it affects: Users with low vision, older users experiencing age-related vision changes, users with reading disabilities, and anyone viewing content on small screens
How to fix: Increase font size from {fontSize}px to at least 16px for body text. Consider using relative units (rem, em) for better scalability.

ID: WarnFormHasNoLabel
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form element has no accessible name to describe its purpose
Why it matters: When a form lacks an accessible name, screen reader users hear only "form" without knowing what the form does - is it a search form, login form, contact form, or something else? Users navigating by landmarks or forms need to understand each form's purpose to decide whether to interact with it. This is especially important on pages with multiple forms. Without proper labeling, users might fill out the wrong form, skip important forms, or waste time exploring forms to understand their purpose.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by forms or landmarks who need to identify form purposes, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels to understand what each form does, and keyboard users who tab through forms and need context about what they're interacting with
How to fix: Add an accessible name to the form element using aria-label (e.g., aria-label="Contact form") or aria-labelledby to reference a visible heading. If the form has a visible heading immediately before it, use aria-labelledby to point to that heading's ID. For search forms, "Search" is usually sufficient. The label should clearly indicate the form's purpose and be unique if there are multiple forms on the page.

---

ID: WarnHeadingOver60CharsLong
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.6
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading text is {length} characters long: "{headingText}"
Why it matters: This heading has {length} characters. Long headings are harder to scan quickly, more difficult to understand at a glance, and can overwhelm users. Screen reader users hearing the full heading text may struggle to grasp the main point. Long headings also cause layout issues on mobile devices and in navigation menus.
Who it affects: Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from concise, clear headings, screen reader users who must listen to the entire heading, users scanning the page quickly for information, and mobile users with limited screen space
How to fix: Shorten the heading to under 60 characters while preserving its meaning. Current: "{headingText}" - Consider breaking into a shorter heading with explanatory text below, or focus on the key message. Use descriptive but concise language.

---

---

ID: WarnIframeTitleNotDescriptive
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Iframe has a title attribute but it's generic or not descriptive (e.g., "iframe", "frame", "embedded content")
Why it matters: Generic iframe titles like "iframe" or "embedded" provide no useful information about the embedded content. Screen reader users hear these unhelpful titles and must enter the iframe to understand what it contains. With multiple iframes, users cannot distinguish between them or determine which ones are worth exploring. This wastes time and creates confusion, especially if iframes contain important functionality like payment forms or videos.
Who it affects: Screen reader users trying to understand and navigate between multiple iframes, keyboard users who encounter iframes in tab order, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling of all content regions, and users trying to navigate efficiently through complex pages
How to fix: Replace generic titles with descriptive ones that explain the iframe's content or purpose. Use specific descriptions like title="YouTube video: Product demo", title="Customer feedback form", title="Live chat support", or title="Interactive map of office locations". Each iframe title should be unique if there are multiple iframes. Avoid redundant words like "iframe" in the title since the element type is already announced.

---

ID: WarnInvalidLangChange
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA)
Touchpoint: language
Description: Language change indicated but with invalid or unrecognized language code
Why it matters: Invalid language codes on content sections prevent screen readers from switching language processors correctly. This can cause content in foreign languages to be pronounced using the wrong language rules, making it incomprehensible. For example, French text might be read with English pronunciation rules. Users expect language changes to be handled smoothly, and invalid codes break this functionality.
Who it affects: Multilingual screen reader users who need proper language switching, users reading content in multiple languages, users with reading disabilities using assistive tools, and users relying on proper pronunciation for comprehension
How to fix: Verify all lang attributes on elements use valid ISO 639 language codes. Common fixes include correcting typos ("fre" → "fr"), using standard codes instead of full names ("French" → "fr"), and ensuring region codes are properly formatted ("en-us" → "en-US"). Test with screen readers to ensure language changes are announced and pronounced correctly.

---

Who it affects: Users with dyslexia, users with cognitive disabilities.
How to fix: Use left-aligned text for body content, avoid full justification.

---

ID: WarnLinkLooksLikeButton
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link is styled to look like a button but uses anchor element
Why it matters: Links and buttons have different behaviors - links navigate to new locations while buttons trigger actions. When links look like buttons, users may have incorrect expectations about what will happen. Keyboard users expect Space key to activate buttons but it doesn't work on links.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who expect button behavior, screen reader users who hear it announced as a link but see it as a button, and users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent interactions
How to fix: If the element performs an action (submit form, open dialog), use a button element. If it navigates to a new URL, keep it as a link but consider whether button styling is appropriate. Ensure keyboard behavior matches the element type.

---

---

ID: WarnMultipleNavNeedsLabel
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Multiple navigation landmarks found without distinguishing labels
Why it matters: When a page has multiple navigation areas (main menu, footer links, breadcrumbs, sidebar navigation), users need to distinguish between them. Without unique labels, screen reader users hear "navigation" multiple times with no indication of which navigation area they're entering. This creates confusion about which menu contains the desired links and requires users to explore each navigation to understand its purpose.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need to distinguish between different navigation areas, keyboard users navigating between multiple menus, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling, and frequent users who want to quickly access specific navigation areas
How to fix: Add unique aria-label attributes to each <nav> element or role="navigation" container. Use descriptive labels like aria-label="Main menu", aria-label="Footer links", aria-label="Breadcrumb", aria-label="Related articles". The labels should clearly indicate the purpose or location of each navigation. Test with screen readers to ensure each navigation is announced with its unique label.

ID: WarnMultipleTitleElements
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: {count} <title> elements found in the document head, which may cause unpredictable behavior
Why it matters: Having {count} title elements causes browsers to choose unpredictably between them, creating inconsistent page identification. Different browsers and assistive technologies may choose different titles from the {count} available, creating an inconsistent experience. SEO is negatively affected as search engines may index the wrong title.
Who it affects: All users seeing inconsistent titles in browser tabs, screen reader users who may hear different titles than what's visually displayed, users bookmarking pages with incorrect titles
How to fix: Remove {count-1} duplicate <title> elements, keeping only one in the document head. Check for scripts that might be adding titles dynamically. Ensure your CMS or framework isn't creating duplicate titles.

ID: WarnNoBannerLandmark
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A), 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A)
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a banner landmark to identify the header/masthead region
Why it matters: The banner landmark identifies the site header containing the logo, primary navigation, and other site-wide content. Without it, screen reader users cannot quickly jump to the header area using landmark navigation. They must read through content linearly to find navigation and branding elements. This is especially frustrating when users want to access the main navigation or return to the homepage via the logo.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly access header content, keyboard users with assistive technology looking for navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and users who frequently need to access header elements like search or main navigation
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <header> element at the page level (not within article, aside, main, nav, or section) as it has an implicit banner role. Alternatively, add role="banner" to your header container. Include site-wide elements like logo, primary navigation, site search, and utility navigation within the banner. Ensure only one banner landmark exists per page at the top level.

---

ID: WarnNoContentinfoLandmark
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a contentinfo landmark to identify the footer region
Why it matters: The contentinfo landmark (typically a footer) contains important information about the page or site such as copyright notices, privacy policies, contact information, and site maps. Screen reader users rely on landmarks to quickly navigate to these common elements without having to read through the entire page. When the footer lacks proper landmark markup, users must search manually through the content to find this information, which is inefficient and may cause them to miss important legal notices or helpful links. The contentinfo landmark provides a consistent, predictable way to access this supplementary information across all pages.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly find footer information, keyboard users who want to efficiently skip to footer content, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and users who need to frequently access footer links like privacy policies or contact information
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <footer> element for your page footer (it has an implicit role of contentinfo when it's not nested inside article, aside, main, nav, or section elements). Alternatively, add role="contentinfo" to the container holding your footer content. Ensure there's only one contentinfo landmark per page at the top level. The footer should contain information about the page or site, not primary content.

ID: WarnNoNavigationLandmark
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page has no navigation landmarks to identify navigation regions
Why it matters: Navigation landmarks identify areas containing navigation links, allowing users to quickly jump to menus without reading through other content. Most web pages have multiple navigation areas (main menu, footer links, sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs) but without proper markup, these are just lists of links mixed with other content. Screen reader users must hunt for navigation areas or listen to all links to find what they need. Navigation landmarks make these areas immediately discoverable and allow users to skip between different navigation regions efficiently.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who use landmarks to find navigation menus quickly, keyboard users navigating complex sites with multiple menus, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear identification of navigation areas, and users with motor disabilities who need to minimize unnecessary navigation
How to fix: Wrap navigation areas in <nav> elements or add role="navigation" to containers with navigation links. If you have multiple navigation areas, label each one with aria-label to distinguish them (e.g., aria-label="Main navigation", aria-label="Footer links", aria-label="Breadcrumb"). Not every group of links needs to be a navigation landmark - use it for major navigation blocks that users would want to find quickly.

ID: WarnPageTitleTooLong
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Page title is {length} characters long, exceeding the recommended 60 character limit
Why it matters: The title "{title}" with {length} characters will get cut off in browser tabs (typically around 30 characters) and search engine results (typically 50-60 characters), losing important information. The most important information might be at the end and never seen. Screen reader users have to listen to lengthy titles repeatedly.
Who it affects: Users with multiple tabs open who see truncated titles, users searching for content who can't see full titles in results, screen reader users who must listen to long titles repeatedly, mobile users with even less space for title display
How to fix: Shorten the title from {length} to under 60 characters. Place the most important, unique information first. Remove unnecessary words like "Welcome to" or "This page contains". Test how titles appear in browser tabs and search results to ensure key information is visible.

---

ID: WarnPageTitleTooShort
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Page title "{found}" is only {length} characters, potentially not descriptive enough
Why it matters: The title "{found}" with only {length} characters doesn't provide enough context, especially when users have multiple tabs open or are browsing history. Users can't distinguish between different sites with the same generic titles. Screen reader users hearing page titles announced need more descriptive information to understand where they are.
Who it affects: Users with multiple browser tabs who need to distinguish between pages, screen reader users who rely on descriptive titles for context, users browsing history or bookmarks, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear page identification
How to fix: Expand "{found}" to be more descriptive by including the site name and page purpose. Aim for 20-60 characters that clearly describe the page content. Ensure each page has a unique, descriptive title that makes sense out of context.

## Issues by Touchpoint

### Images

ID: DiscoFoundSvgImage
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: SVG element with role="img" detected that requires manual review to verify appropriate text alternatives are provided
Why it matters: SVG elements with role="img" are explicitly marked as images and treated as a single graphic by assistive technologies, requiring appropriate text alternatives. While the role="img" indicates developer awareness of accessibility needs, manual review is needed to verify that any aria-label, aria-labelledby, or internal <title> elements adequately describe the image's content or function, and that the description is appropriate for the SVG's context and purpose.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who depend on text alternatives to understand image content.
How to fix: Verify the SVG with role="img" has appropriate accessible names through aria-label or aria-labelledby attributes, ensure any <title> or <desc> elements inside the SVG are properly referenced if used for labeling, confirm decorative SVGs are hidden with aria-hidden="true" rather than given role="img", check that the text alternative accurately describes the SVG's meaning in context, and test with screen readers to ensure the image is announced with meaningful information

ID: ErrAltOnElementThatDoesntTakeIt
Type: Error
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Alt attribute placed on HTML elements that don't support it (such as div, span, p, or other non-image elements), making the alternative text inaccessible to assistive technologies
Why it matters: The alt attribute is only valid on specific elements (<img>, <area>, <input type="image">) and is ignored when placed on other elements. Screen readers will not announce this misplaced alt text, meaning any important information it contains is completely lost to users who rely on assistive technologies. This often occurs when developers attempt to add accessibility features but use incorrect techniques.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who cannot access the alternative text content placed in invalid locations, users with cognitive disabilities who may be missing explanatory text, keyboard users who may not receive important contextual information, and users of assistive technologies that rely on proper semantic HTML markup
How to fix: Remove alt attributes from non-supporting elements and use appropriate alternatives - for background images in CSS use role="img" with aria-label, for clickable elements use aria-label or visually hidden text, for decorative elements ensure they're properly hidden with aria-hidden="true", and verify that actual <img> elements are used for content images that need alternative text

ID: ErrImageAltContainsHTML
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Image's alternative text contains HTML markup tags
Why it matters: HTML in alt text is not parsed, so screen readers will read the HTML markup as literal characters. Users will hear angle brackets announced as "less than" or "greater than" and tag names spelled out, creating a confusing experience. For example, alt="<b>Team Photo</b>" would be read as "less than b greater than Team Photo less than slash b greater than".
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who will hear nonsense characters and words interspersed with the actual alt text, making it difficult or impossible to understand the image content
How to fix: Remove all HTML markup from alt attributes and use only plain text. If formatting or structure is important to convey, describe it in words rather than using markup (e.g., instead of "<em>Important</em>" use "Important, emphasized").

ID: ErrImageWithEmptyAlt
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Image alt attribute contains only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, line breaks), providing no accessible name
Why it matters: Whitespace-only alt attributes fail to provide any accessible name for the image, causing screen readers to announce unhelpful fallback information like the image filename or "unlabeled graphic". Unlike properly empty alt="" which signals decorative content, whitespace alt text creates ambiguity - users cannot determine if they're missing important information or if the image is decorative.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users relying on screen readers who cannot determine the image's purpose or content, users with cognitive disabilities who depend on clear labeling to understand page content, and users of voice control software who cannot reference images without accessible names
How to fix: Determine the image's purpose and apply appropriate alt text - for informative images add descriptive alternative text that conveys the same information, for decorative images use alt="" (no spaces) to properly mark them as decorative, for functional images describe the action or destination not the appearance, and remove any whitespace-only alt attributes that serve as ineffective placeholders

ID: ErrImageWithImgFileExtensionAlt
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Alt text contains image filename with file extension (e.g., "photo.jpg", "IMG_1234.png", "banner.gif"), providing no meaningful description of the image content
Why it matters: Filenames rarely describe image content meaningfully and often contain technical identifiers, underscores, hyphens, or numbers that create a poor listening experience when announced by screen readers. Users hear cryptic strings like "DSC underscore zero zero four two dot jay peg" instead of learning what the image actually shows, forcing them to guess at important visual information or miss it entirely.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need meaningful descriptions to understand visual content, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on clear, descriptive text to process information, users in low-bandwidth situations where images don't load and only alt text is displayed, and search engine users who rely on descriptive alt text for finding relevant content
How to fix: Replace the filename with descriptive text that conveys the image's information or purpose (change alt="hero-banner-2.jpg" to alt="Students collaborating in the campus library"), focus on what the image communicates rather than technical details, ensure the description makes sense when read in context with surrounding content, and avoid including file extensions or technical metadata in alt attributes

ID: ErrImageWithNoAlt
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Images are missing alternative text attributes, preventing assistive technologies from conveying their content or purpose to users
Why it matters: Screen readers cannot describe image content to users who are blind or have low vision, creating information barriers that may prevent understanding of essential content, navigation, or task completion. This also affects users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from text alternatives and users on slow connections where images fail to load.
Who it affects: Blind users using screen readers, users with low vision using screen readers with magnification, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on text alternatives, voice control users who need text labels to reference elements, and users on slow internet connections
How to fix: Add descriptive alt attributes for informative images (alt="Sales chart showing 40% increase"), use empty alt attributes for decorative images (alt=""), describe the function for interactive images (alt="Search" not alt="magnifying glass icon"), and provide detailed descriptions via aria-describedby for complex images like charts or diagrams.

ID: ErrImageWithURLAsAlt
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: Alt attribute contains a URL (starting with http://, https://, www., or file://) instead of descriptive text about the image content
Why it matters: URLs provide no meaningful information about what an image shows or its purpose on the page. Screen reader users hear lengthy, difficult-to-parse web addresses being spelled out character by character or in chunks like "h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash-w-w-w-dot", creating a frustrating experience that conveys nothing about the actual image content. This often happens when image source URLs are mistakenly copied into alt attributes.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need meaningful descriptions instead of technical URLs, users with cognitive disabilities who cannot process or remember long URL strings to understand image content, users in low-bandwidth situations where only alt text displays when images fail to load, and voice control users who cannot effectively reference images labeled with URLs
How to fix: Replace the URL with descriptive text that conveys what the image shows or its function (change alt="https://example.com/images/team-photo.jpg" to alt="Marketing team at annual conference"), focus on describing the image content rather than its location or technical details, ensure the description makes sense in the page context, and never use the image's web address as its alternative text

ID: ErrSvgImageNoLabel
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
Touchpoint: Images
Description: SVG image element lacks accessible text alternatives, making it invisible to screen reader users
Why it matters: SVG images without proper labeling are completely inaccessible to screen reader users - they are either skipped entirely or announced as "graphic" with no indication of what they represent. Unlike HTML img elements that can use alt attributes, SVGs require different techniques for accessibility. Without proper labeling, users miss important visual information, icons, charts, logos, or interactive graphics that may be essential for understanding or using the page.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who cannot perceive any information about unlabeled SVG content, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from text descriptions of complex graphics, keyboard users who may encounter interactive SVGs without understanding their purpose, and users of assistive technologies that need text alternatives for all visual content
How to fix: For simple SVGs, add role="img" and aria-label with descriptive text. For complex SVGs, use <title> as the first child element and reference it with aria-labelledby. For decorative SVGs, use aria-hidden="true" to hide from assistive technologies. For inline SVGs containing text, ensure text is in actual text elements not paths. For interactive SVGs, provide appropriate ARIA labels for all interactive elements. Always test with screen readers to verify SVGs are properly announced.

Who it affects: Keyboard users, screen reader users
How to fix: Replace {element_tag} with <button> element or add role="button" and tabindex="0"

ID: ErrButtonNoVisibleFocus
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible
Touchpoint: buttons
Description: Button lacks visible focus indicator when focused
Why it matters: Keyboard users need visible focus indicators to know which element is currently selected. Without clear focus indication on buttons, users cannot tell which button will be activated when they press Enter or Space, leading to errors and inability to use the interface effectively.
Who it affects: Users with motor disabilities using keyboard navigation, users who cannot use a mouse, power users who prefer keyboard navigation, and users of assistive technologies
How to fix: Ensure buttons have a clearly visible focus indicator with at least 3:1 contrast against the background. The indicator should be at least 2 pixels thick and not rely on color alone. Never remove focus indicators without providing an alternative. Consider using :focus-visible for refined focus management.

ID: ErrButtonTextLowContrast
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
Touchpoint: buttons
Description: Button text has insufficient color contrast with button background
Why it matters: Users with low vision, color blindness, or viewing the page in bright sunlight may not be able to read button labels if contrast is insufficient. This prevents users from understanding button purpose and can make critical functions inaccessible. Buttons are action triggers, so being unable to read them can prevent task completion.
Who it affects: Users with low vision, color blindness, age-related vision changes, and anyone viewing content in poor lighting conditions or on low-quality displays
How to fix: Ensure button text has at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the button background for normal text, or 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold). For Level AAA compliance, use 7:1 for normal text. Test in different states (hover, focus, active) as contrast requirements apply to all states. Avoid using color alone to indicate button state.

ID: WarnButtonGenericText
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: buttons
Description: Button uses generic text like "Click here", "Submit", or "OK" without context
Why it matters: Screen reader users often navigate by pulling up a list of all buttons on a page. Generic button text provides no information about what the button does when heard out of context. Users cannot determine the button's purpose without additional exploration, slowing navigation and potentially causing errors.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by buttons list, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels, and screen magnifier users who may not see surrounding context
How to fix: Use descriptive button text that explains the action (e.g., "Submit registration form" instead of "Submit", "Download PDF report" instead of "Download"). The button text should make sense when read in isolation. If visual design constraints require short text, use aria-label to provide a more descriptive accessible name.

Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Large text fails WCAG AA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This large text ({fontSize}px) with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AA requirements. Large text (24px+ or 18.66px+ bold) requires a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 to pass Level AA. The foreground color ({fg}) against background ({bg}) doesn't provide enough distinction.
Who it affects: Users with low vision, color blindness, or age-related vision changes who struggle to distinguish text with insufficient contrast, even when the text is larger
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AA requires at least 3:1 for large text. To fix, adjust the foreground color from {fg} or the background from {bg}. Consider using #949494 or darker on white background for large text.

ID: ErrLargeTextContrastAAA
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Large text fails WCAG AAA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This large text ({fontSize}px) with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AAA enhanced requirements. Large text (24px+ or 18.66px+ bold) requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to pass Level AAA for enhanced accessibility.
Who it affects: Users with moderate visual impairments who benefit from enhanced contrast even for large text, ensuring optimal readability in all conditions
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AAA requires at least 4.5:1 for large text. To fix, adjust colors to achieve higher contrast, such as #767676 or darker on white background for large text at Level AAA.

ID: ErrTextContrastAA
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Text fails WCAG AA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This text with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AA requirements. Normal text requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to pass Level AA. The foreground color ({fg}) against the background ({bg}) doesn't provide enough distinction for users with visual impairments.
Who it affects: Users with low vision who need higher contrast to distinguish text, users with color blindness, older users experiencing age-related vision changes, and users viewing content in bright sunlight or on low-quality displays
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AA requires at least 4.5:1 for normal text ({fontSize}px). To fix, darken the foreground color from {fg} or lighten the background from {bg}. Consider using #595959 or darker on white background, or #FFFFFF on backgrounds darker than #767676.

ID: ErrTextContrastAAA
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)
Touchpoint: color
Description: Text fails WCAG AAA with contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 (foreground: {fg}, background: {bg})
Why it matters: This text with a contrast ratio of {ratio}:1 does not meet WCAG Level AAA enhanced requirements. Normal text requires a minimum contrast ratio of 7:1 to pass Level AAA. The foreground color ({fg}) against the background ({bg}) doesn't provide optimal distinction for maximum accessibility.
Who it affects: Users with moderate visual impairments, including those with low vision, color blindness, or contrast sensitivity who benefit from enhanced contrast for optimal readability
How to fix: Current contrast is {ratio}:1, but WCAG Level AAA requires at least 7:1 for normal text ({fontSize}px). To fix, use high contrast combinations like #333333 or darker on white background, or white text on backgrounds darker than #565656.

ID: WarnColorRelatedStyleDefinedExplicitlyInElement
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum), 1.4.8 Visual Presentation
Touchpoint: color
Description: Color-related CSS properties found in inline style attributes on HTML elements
Why it matters: Inline color styles bypass user stylesheets and browser extensions that help users with visual disabilities customize colors for better readability. Users who need high contrast, inverted colors, or specific color schemes cannot easily override inline styles. This also makes it difficult to implement dark mode, maintain consistent theming, or allow user color preferences.
Who it affects: Users with low vision who need high contrast or specific color combinations, users with color blindness who need to adjust problematic color pairs, users with dyslexia who benefit from specific background colors, users with light sensitivity who need dark themes, and users who rely on browser extensions for color customization
How to fix: Move color-related styles (color, background-color, border-color, etc.) to external CSS files using classes. This allows users to override styles with their own stylesheets, enables easier theme switching, improves maintainability, and supports user preference media queries like prefers-color-scheme. Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors to make customization even easier.

ID: WarnColorRelatedStyleDefinedExplicitlyInStyleTag
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum), 1.4.8 Visual Presentation
Touchpoint: color
Description: Color-related CSS found in <style> tags within the HTML document instead of external stylesheets
Why it matters: Embedded styles in <style> tags are harder for users to override than external stylesheets and may not be cached efficiently. Users with visual disabilities who need custom color schemes must use more aggressive CSS overrides. This approach also makes it difficult to maintain consistent theming across pages and prevents users from disabling styles entirely if needed.
Who it affects: Users with low vision requiring custom color schemes, users with photosensitivity needing to modify bright colors, users with color blindness who need to adjust color combinations, and users who benefit from consistent, predictable styling across pages
How to fix: Move color styles to external CSS files linked with <link> tags. Organize colors using CSS custom properties for easy theming. Implement user preference support with @media (prefers-color-scheme) and similar queries. Consider providing theme switcher functionality. Ensure your external stylesheets are properly cached for performance.

### dialogs

ID: AI_ErrDialogWithoutARIA
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.1.1, 4.1.2, 2.4.3
Touchpoint: dialogs
Description: {element_tag} element "{element_text}" appears to be a dialog/modal but lacks proper ARIA markup
Why it matters: Without proper ARIA attributes, screen readers cannot announce the dialog's purpose, state, or provide proper navigation
Who it affects: Screen reader users, keyboard users who need focus management
How to fix: Add role="dialog", aria-modal="true", aria-label or aria-labelledby, and implement focus trap

ID: AI_ErrModalFocusTrap
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.1.2, 2.4.3
Touchpoint: dialogs
Description: Modal/dialog "{element_text}" does not properly trap focus
Why it matters: Without focus trapping, keyboard users can navigate outside the modal while it's open, causing confusion
Who it affects: Keyboard users, screen reader users
How to fix: Implement focus trap to keep focus within modal while open, and return focus to trigger element on close

### focus

ID: AI_ErrMissingFocusIndicator
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Interactive element lacks visible focus indicator
Why it matters: Users can't see which element has keyboard focus
Who it affects: Keyboard users, users with attention or memory issues
How to fix: Add CSS :focus styles with visible outline, border, or background change

ID: ErrInvalidTabindex
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Element has a tabindex attribute with an invalid value (non-numeric or decimal)
Why it matters: Invalid tabindex values are ignored by browsers, potentially making interactive elements unreachable by keyboard or creating unpredictable focus behavior. This can completely block keyboard users from accessing functionality. The element might be skipped during tabbing, receive focus unexpectedly, or behave differently across browsers.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who cannot reach or interact with the element, screen reader users who may miss important interactive controls, users with motor disabilities relying on keyboard navigation, and users who cannot use a mouse
How to fix: Use only valid integer values for tabindex: "0" to include in natural tab order, "-1" to remove from tab order but allow programmatic focus, or remove the tabindex attribute entirely if the element shouldn't be focusable. Never use decimal values (1.5), text ("first"), or empty values (tabindex="").

ID: ErrNegativeTabindex
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.3
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Negative tabindex on interactive element
Why it matters: Element removed from tab order
Who it affects: Keyboard users
How to fix: Use tabindex="0" for interactive elements

ID: ErrNoFocusIndicator
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Interactive element has no visible focus indicator when focused, making keyboard navigation impossible to track
Why it matters: Focus indicators show keyboard users where they are on the page - without them, it's like navigating in the dark. Users cannot see which element will be activated when they press Enter or Space, making it impossible to navigate confidently. They might activate the wrong control, skip important content, or become completely lost on the page. This is especially critical for forms where activating the wrong button could submit incomplete data or cancel an operation.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who need to see their current position, users with attention or memory disabilities who lose track of focus position, users with low vision who need clear visual indicators, users with motor disabilities who need to carefully track navigation, and any user who temporarily cannot use a mouse
How to fix: Ensure all interactive elements have a visible focus indicator using CSS :focus styles. Add outline, border, background color, or box-shadow changes. Make focus indicators clearly visible with sufficient color contrast (3:1 minimum). Never use outline: none without providing an alternative indicator. Consider using :focus-visible for keyboard-only focus styles. Test by tabbing through your entire page to ensure every interactive element shows focus clearly.

ID: ErrNoOutlineOffsetDefined
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.7
Touchpoint: focus
Description: No outline offset defined for focus
Why it matters: Focus indicator may be hard to see
Who it affects: Keyboard users
How to fix: Add outline-offset for better visibility

ID: ErrOutlineIsNoneOnInteractiveElement
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Interactive element has CSS outline:none removing the default focus indicator
Why it matters: People with mobility disabilities use keyboard or keyboard-alternate devices to navigate rather than a mouse. Visible focus indicators are essential as they perform the same function as a mouse cursor. Without focus indicators, users cannot tell where they are on the page or when interactive elements are focused. This makes keyboard navigation impossible and can completely prevent access to functionality.
Who it affects: Sighted users with motor disabilities navigating with keyboard or keyboard-alternate devices, users who prefer keyboard navigation for efficiency, users with temporary injuries preventing mouse use, and users of assistive technologies that rely on keyboard navigation
How to fix: Never use outline:none without providing an alternative visible focus indicator. The focus indicator must be clearly visible with at least 3:1 contrast ratio with the background, be at least 2 pixels thick, and ideally be offset from the element to maximize visibility. Consider using CSS :focus-visible for better control over when focus indicators appear.

ID: ErrPositiveTabindex
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.3 Focus Order
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Element uses a positive tabindex value (greater than 0)
Why it matters: Positive tabindex values override the natural tab order of the page, creating an unpredictable navigation experience. When you use tabindex="1" or higher, that element jumps to the front of the tab order, regardless of where it appears visually. This breaks the expected top-to-bottom, left-to-right flow that keyboard users rely on. Users might tab from the header straight to a random form field in the middle of the page, then jump to the footer, then back to the navigation. This confusing order makes it easy to miss content, difficult to predict where focus will go next, and nearly impossible to maintain as the page evolves.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who expect logical, predictable navigation order, screen reader users who rely on consistent focus flow, users with motor disabilities who need efficient keyboard navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who are confused by unpredictable focus movement, and developers maintaining the code who must manage complex tabindex values
How to fix: Remove positive tabindex values and use only tabindex="0" (adds element to natural tab order) or tabindex="-1" (removes from tab order but allows programmatic focus). Let the DOM order determine tab order - if elements need to be reached in a different order, rearrange them in the HTML. If visual order must differ from DOM order for design reasons, consider using CSS Grid or Flexbox with the order property, but be cautious as this can still cause accessibility issues.

ID: ErrTTabindexOnNonInteractiveElement

How to fix: Remove tabindex from non-interactive elements

ID: ErrTransparentFocusIndicator
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Focus indicator uses transparent or nearly transparent color, making it effectively invisible
Why it matters: A transparent focus indicator is functionally the same as no focus indicator - users cannot see where keyboard focus is located. This might occur from using rgba with 0 or very low alpha values, setting outline-color to transparent, or using colors that match the background. The focus indicator exists technically but provides no practical benefit to users trying to navigate.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who need visible focus indicators to navigate, users with low vision who need clear visual cues, users with color blindness who may already struggle with certain color combinations, and users with cognitive disabilities who need obvious focus indicators
How to fix: Use opaque colors with sufficient contrast for focus indicators. Replace transparent outlines with visible colors, ensure at least 3:1 contrast ratio between focus indicator and background, use solid colors or high alpha values (0.7 or higher) for rgba colors. Test focus indicators on different backgrounds across your site. Consider using box-shadow or background changes as additional focus indicators.

ID: ErrWrongTabindexForInteractiveElement

Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A), 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form element is using title attribute as its only accessible label, which is insufficient for accessibility
Why it matters: When title is the only labeling mechanism for a form field, many users cannot determine what information to enter. Title attributes are not announced by screen readers when navigating forms in normal mode, don't appear on mobile devices, cannot be accessed by keyboard users, and disappear too quickly for many users to read. This makes the form field essentially unlabeled for a large portion of users, preventing them from completing forms successfully.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who won't hear the field's purpose when navigating the form, mobile users who cannot see title tooltips at all, keyboard users who cannot hover to see the tooltip, users with motor disabilities who struggle with precise hovering, users with cognitive disabilities who need persistent labels as memory aids, and voice control users who cannot reference fields without visible labels
How to fix: Add a proper visible <label> element associated with the form field using the 'for' attribute. If space is limited, use placeholder text in addition to (not instead of) a label. For complex layouts, consider using aria-labelledby to reference existing visible text. If you must use aria-label, ensure it's descriptive and consider adding visible text for sighted users. Never rely solely on title attributes for labeling form fields - they should only supplement proper labels, not replace them.

ID: ErrUnlabelledField
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form input element lacks an accessible name through <label>, aria-label, aria-labelledby, or other labeling methods, leaving the field's purpose undefined for assistive technologies
Why it matters: Without labels, users cannot determine what information to enter, leading to form errors, abandoned transactions, and inability to complete critical tasks. Screen readers announce only the field type like "edit" or "combo box" without context, forcing users to guess based on surrounding content that may not be programmatically associated. This creates barriers for independent form completion and may result in users submitting incorrect information or being unable to proceed.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who hear no field description when navigating forms, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels to understand what information is required, users with motor disabilities using voice control who cannot reference unlabeled fields by name, mobile users where placeholder text may disappear on focus, and users who rely on browser autofill features that depend on proper field labeling
How to fix: Add explicit <label> elements with for attribute matching the input's id (preferred method), use aria-label for simple labels when visual text isn't needed, implement aria-labelledby to reference existing visible text, ensure placeholder text is not the only labeling method as it disappears on input, wrap inputs and label text together for implicit association, and verify all form controls including select elements, textareas, and custom widgets have accessible names

Type: Info
Impact: N/A
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Field is labeled using aria-label="{found}", which is valid but may have usability considerations
Why it matters: While aria-label="{found}" is a valid way to label this form field, it has limitations: the label "{found}" is not visible on screen which can confuse sighted users, voice control users cannot reference the field by the visible text "{found}", the label won't be automatically translated by browser translation tools, and users with cognitive disabilities benefit from visible labels as memory aids.
Who it affects: Sighted users who can't see "{found}" as a label, voice control users who can't say "click {found}", users relying on browser translation, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from persistent visible labels
How to fix: Consider if a visible label showing "{found}" would better serve all users. If space permits, use a visible <label> element with the text "{found}". If aria-label must be used, ensure "{found}" is clear and descriptive. Consider adding visible helper text or placeholder text to provide visual context.

WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form element has no accessible name to describe its purpose
Why it matters: When a form lacks an accessible name, screen reader users hear only "form" without knowing what the form does - is it a search form, login form, contact form, or something else? Users navigating by landmarks or forms need to understand each form's purpose to decide whether to interact with it. This is especially important on pages with multiple forms. Without proper labeling, users might fill out the wrong form, skip important forms, or waste time exploring forms to understand their purpose.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by forms or landmarks who need to identify form purposes, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels to understand what each form does, and keyboard users who tab through forms and need context about what they're interacting with
How to fix: Add an accessible name to the form element using aria-label (e.g., aria-label="Contact form") or aria-labelledby to reference a visible heading. If the form has a visible heading immediately before it, use aria-labelledby to point to that heading's ID. For search forms, "Search" is usually sufficient. The label should clearly indicate the form's purpose and be unique if there are multiple forms on the page.

Why it matters: Screen reader users won't recognize this text as a heading, breaking navigation and document structure

How to fix: Use appropriate HTML heading tags (h1-h6) for text that serves as headings

ID: ErrEmptyHeading
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading element contains only whitespace or special characters: "{text}"
Why it matters: This heading contains only "{text}" which provides no meaningful content. Empty headings disrupt document structure and navigation. Screen reader users rely on headings to understand page organization and navigate efficiently using heading shortcuts. An empty heading creates a navigation point with no information, confusing users about the page structure.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by headings and find a heading containing only "{text}", users with cognitive disabilities who rely on clear structure to understand content organization, and users of assistive technologies that generate page outlines
How to fix: Either replace "{text}" with meaningful text content that describes the section, or remove the empty heading element entirely if it serves no structural purpose. Never use headings for visual spacing - use CSS margin/padding instead.

ID: ErrMultipleH1
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Page contains {count} h1 elements instead of just one
Why it matters: Having {count} h1 elements creates confusion about the page's main topic. Each h1 represents a primary heading, and multiple h1s suggest multiple main topics, breaking the document hierarchy. Screen readers users won't know which h1 represents the actual page topic.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who expect a single h1 to identify the page topic, users navigating by headings who see multiple "top level" items, SEO and search engines that look for a single main topic
How to fix: Keep only one h1 that represents the main page topic. Change the other h1 elements to h2 or appropriate lower levels based on their relationship to the main topic.

ID: ErrNoHeadingsOnPage
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: No heading elements (h1-h6) found anywhere on the page
Why it matters: Headings create the structural outline of your content, like a table of contents. They allow users to understand how information is organized and navigate directly to sections of interest. Without any headings, screen reader users cannot use heading navigation shortcuts (one of their primary navigation methods) and must read through all content linearly. This is like forcing someone to read an entire book without chapter titles or section breaks. Users cannot skim content, jump to relevant sections, or understand the information hierarchy. For users with cognitive disabilities, the lack of visual structure makes content overwhelming and hard to process.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who lose a critical navigation method and cannot understand content structure, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear visual organization to process information, users with attention disorders who rely on headings to focus on relevant sections, and users with reading disabilities who use headings to break content into manageable chunks
How to fix: Add semantic heading elements (h1-h6) to structure your content. Start with one h1 that describes the main page topic. Use h2 for major sections, h3 for subsections, and so on. Don't skip levels (e.g., h1 to h3). Ensure headings describe the content that follows them. Never use headings just for visual styling - they must represent actual content structure. If you need large text without semantic meaning, use CSS instead.

ID: ErrHeadingOrder
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Headings appear in illogical order - high-level headings (H1, H2) appear after lower-level headings (H3, H4, H5, H6)
Why it matters: Document structure should be logical and predictable. When high-level headings like H1 or H2 appear after lower-level headings, it creates a backwards or inverted hierarchy. This is like reading a book where chapter titles appear after section headings, or where the main title appears at the end. Screen reader users navigating by headings expect the most important headings first, followed by progressively more detailed subsections. When headings appear out of logical order, users cannot understand the content structure, may miss important navigation landmarks, and cannot build an accurate mental model of how the page is organized.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who rely on heading navigation and expect logical document structure, users with cognitive disabilities who need predictable content organization, users who generate document outlines from headings, and users who navigate by heading levels to understand content hierarchy
How to fix: Restructure your content so that high-level headings (H1, H2) appear before lower-level headings. Start with H1 for the main page title, then H2 for major sections, then H3 for subsections within those. Headings should appear in a logical, top-down hierarchy that matches how users would naturally read and understand the content structure.

ID: ErrSkippedHeadingLevel
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading levels are not in sequential order - jumped from h{skippedFrom} to h{skippedTo}, skipping intermediate level(s)
Why it matters: Heading levels create a hierarchical outline of your content, like nested bullet points. Jumping from h{skippedFrom} to h{skippedTo} breaks this logical structure. It's like having chapter {skippedFrom}, then jumping to section {skippedTo} without the intermediate section. Screen reader users navigating by headings will be confused about the relationship between sections - is the h{skippedTo} a subsection of something that's missing? This broken hierarchy makes it hard to understand how content is organized and can cause users to think content is missing or that they've accidentally skipped something.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by heading structure who rely on levels to understand content relationships, users with cognitive disabilities who need logical, predictable content organization, users of assistive technology that generates document outlines, and developers or content authors maintaining the page who need to understand the intended structure
How to fix: Insert an h{expectedLevel} heading between the h{skippedFrom} and h{skippedTo}, or change the h{skippedTo} to h{expectedLevel} to maintain sequential order. After h{skippedFrom}, use h{expectedLevel} for the next level. Don't skip levels when going down the hierarchy. If you need a heading to look smaller visually, use CSS to style it rather than choosing a lower heading level. The heading level should reflect the content's logical structure, not its visual appearance.

Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.6
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading text is {length} characters long: "{headingText}"
Why it matters: This heading has {length} characters. Long headings are harder to scan quickly, more difficult to understand at a glance, and can overwhelm users. Screen reader users hearing the full heading text may struggle to grasp the main point. Long headings also cause layout issues on mobile devices and in navigation menus.
Who it affects: Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from concise, clear headings, screen reader users who must listen to the entire heading, users scanning the page quickly for information, and mobile users with limited screen space
How to fix: Shorten the heading to under 60 characters while preserving its meaning. Current: "{headingText}" - Consider breaking into a shorter heading with explanatory text below, or focus on the key message. Use descriptive but concise language.

WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Multiple main landmark regions found on the page
Why it matters: The main landmark should contain THE primary content of the page - having multiple main landmarks is like having multiple "Chapter 1" sections in a book. It confuses the page structure and defeats the purpose of landmarks. Screen reader users expecting to jump to the main content won't know which landmark contains the actual primary content. They might land in the wrong section, miss important content, or have to check multiple "main" areas. This ambiguity makes the landmark system unreliable and forces users back to linear navigation.
Who it affects: Screen reader users relying on the main landmark to skip to primary content, keyboard users using landmark navigation extensions, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear, unambiguous page structure, and developers trying to understand the intended page structure
How to fix: Use only one <main> element or role="main" per page. Identify which content is truly the primary, unique content for that page and wrap only that in the main landmark. If you have multiple important sections, use other appropriate landmarks (article, section) or headings to structure them within the single main landmark. The main should contain all unique page content but exclude repeated elements like headers, navigation, and footers.

WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a banner landmark to identify the site header region
Why it matters: The banner landmark identifies the site header which typically contains the site logo, main navigation, and search functionality. This content appears consistently across pages and users expect to find it at the top. Without proper banner markup, screen reader users cannot quickly jump to the header area using landmark navigation shortcuts. They must instead navigate through all content linearly or guess where the header content begins and ends. This makes it difficult to access primary navigation or return to the site homepage via the logo link, tasks that sighted users can do instantly by looking at the top of the page.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who use landmark navigation to quickly access site navigation and branding, keyboard users who want to efficiently navigate to header elements, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure to orient themselves, and users with low vision using screen magnifiers who need to quickly locate navigation elements
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <header> element for your site header (it has an implicit role of banner when it's not nested inside article, aside, main, nav, or section elements). Alternatively, add role="banner" to the container holding your header content. There should typically be only one banner landmark per page at the top level. Include site-wide content like logo, primary navigation, and site search within the banner landmark.

Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a main landmark region to identify the primary content area
Why it matters: Screen reader users rely on landmarks to understand page layout and quickly navigate to important sections. The main landmark allows users to skip repeated content like headers and navigation to jump directly to the unique page content. Without it, users must navigate through all repeated elements on every page, which is time-consuming and frustrating. The main landmark should contain all content that is unique to the page, including the h1 heading.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who navigate by landmarks, users with motor disabilities who need efficient keyboard navigation to skip repeated content, and users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clear page structure
How to fix: Add a <main> element around the primary content area, or use role="main" on an appropriate container element. Ensure there is only one main landmark per page, position it as a top-level landmark (not nested inside other landmarks), and include all unique page content within it, including the h1 heading. The main landmark should not include repeated content like site headers, navigation, or footers.

Description: Important content found outside of any landmark region, making it harder for screen reader users to find and navigate to
Why it matters: Landmarks create a navigable structure for your page, like a table of contents. Content outside landmarks is like having chapters missing from the table of contents - users may never find it when navigating by landmarks. Screen reader users often jump between landmarks to quickly scan page structure, and content outside landmarks requires them to read through the entire page linearly to discover it. This particularly affects users who are familiar with your site and want to quickly navigate to specific content areas.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to efficiently explore pages, keyboard users using browser extensions for landmark navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and power users who use landmarks for quick navigation
How to fix: Ensure all meaningful content is contained within appropriate landmark regions. Typically: use <header> or role="banner" for site headers, <nav> or role="navigation" for navigation menus, <main> or role="main" for primary content, <aside> or role="complementary" for sidebar content, <footer> or role="contentinfo" for footers. Decorative content or spacers can remain outside landmarks. Review your page structure to ensure no important content is orphaned outside the landmark structure.

Without unique labels, screen reader users hear "navigation" multiple times with no indication of which navigation area they're entering. This creates confusion about which menu contains the desired links and requires users to explore each navigation to understand its purpose.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need to distinguish between different navigation areas, keyboard users navigating between multiple menus, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling, and frequent users who want to quickly access specific navigation areas
How to fix: Add unique aria-label attributes to each <nav> element or role="navigation" container. Use descriptive labels like aria-label="Main menu", aria-label="Footer links", aria-label="Breadcrumb", aria-label="Related articles". The labels should clearly indicate the purpose or location of each navigation. Test with screen readers to ensure each navigation is announced with its unique label.

Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a banner landmark to identify the header/masthead region
Why it matters: The banner landmark identifies the site header containing the logo, primary navigation, and other site-wide content. Without it, screen reader users cannot quickly jump to the header area using landmark navigation. They must read through content linearly to find navigation and branding elements. This is especially frustrating when users want to access the main navigation or return to the homepage via the logo.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly access header content, keyboard users with assistive technology looking for navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and users who frequently need to access header elements like search or main navigation
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <header> element at the page level (not within article, aside, main, nav, or section) as it has an implicit banner role. Alternatively, add role="banner" to your header container. Include site-wide elements like logo, primary navigation, site search, and utility navigation within the banner. Ensure only one banner landmark exists per page at the top level.

Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a contentinfo landmark to identify the footer region
Why it matters: The contentinfo landmark (typically a footer) contains important information about the page or site such as copyright notices, privacy policies, contact information, and site maps. Screen reader users rely on landmarks to quickly navigate to these common elements without having to read through the entire page. When the footer lacks proper landmark markup, users must search manually through the content to find this information, which is inefficient and may cause them to miss important legal notices or helpful links. The contentinfo landmark provides a consistent, predictable way to access this supplementary information across all pages.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly find footer information, keyboard users who want to efficiently skip to footer content, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and users who need to frequently access footer links like privacy policies or contact information
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <footer> element for your page footer (it has an implicit role of contentinfo when it's not nested inside article, aside, main, nav, or section elements). Alternatively, add role="contentinfo" to the container holding your footer content. Ensure there's only one contentinfo landmark per page at the top level. The footer should contain information about the page or site, not primary content.

Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page has no navigation landmarks to identify navigation regions
Why it matters: Navigation landmarks identify areas containing navigation links, allowing users to quickly jump to menus without reading through other content. Most web pages have multiple navigation areas (main menu, footer links, sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs) but without proper markup, these are just lists of links mixed with other content. Screen reader users must hunt for navigation areas or listen to all links to find what they need. Navigation landmarks make these areas immediately discoverable and allow users to skip between different navigation regions efficiently.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who use landmarks to find navigation menus quickly, keyboard users navigating complex sites with multiple menus, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear identification of navigation areas, and users with motor disabilities who need to minimize unnecessary navigation
How to fix: Wrap navigation areas in <nav> elements or add role="navigation" to containers with navigation links. If you have multiple navigation areas, label each one with aria-label to distinguish them (e.g., aria-label="Main navigation", aria-label="Footer links", aria-label="Breadcrumb"). Not every group of links needs to be a navigation landmark - use it for major navigation blocks that users would want to find quickly.

WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A), 3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA)
Touchpoint: language
Description: Language attribute contains invalid code '{found}' that doesn't conform to ISO 639 standards
Why it matters: The language code '{found}' is not recognized as a valid ISO 639 language code. This prevents assistive technologies from properly processing content, causing screen readers to mispronounce words, use incorrect inflection patterns, or fail to switch language engines. This can make content difficult or impossible to understand when read aloud, especially if the content is in a non-English language but gets read with English pronunciation rules.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users relying on screen readers for accurate pronunciation, multilingual users who need proper language identification for comprehension, users with reading disabilities using text-to-speech tools, and international users accessing content in multiple languages
How to fix: Replace '{found}' with a valid ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 language code. If '{found}' appears to be English, use "en". Common corrections: "english" → "en", "spanish" → "es", "french" → "fr", "deutsch" → "de", "eng" → "en". For regional variants use BCP 47 format (e.g., "en-US", "en-GB", "es-MX"). Check the official ISO 639 registry for the correct code.

Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)
Touchpoint: language
Description: HTML element is missing the lang attribute, preventing assistive technologies from determining the primary language of the page
Why it matters: Without a declared language, screen readers cannot determine which pronunciation rules and voice synthesizer to use, often defaulting to the user's system language which may be incorrect. This causes mispronunciation, incorrect inflection, and can make content unintelligible, especially for pages in languages different from the user's default settings.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need correct pronunciation for comprehension, international users accessing content in different languages, users with dyslexia or reading disabilities using assistive reading tools, and users of automatic translation services
How to fix: Add the lang attribute to the <html> element with the appropriate language code (e.g., <html lang="en"> for English, <html lang="fr"> for French). Use ISO 639-1 two-letter codes for modern languages. For XHTML, also include xml:lang with the same value. Ensure the declared language matches the actual primary language of your content. For multilingual pages, use the language that represents the majority of the content.

Description: Language change indicated but with invalid or unrecognized language code
Why it matters: Invalid language codes on content sections prevent screen readers from switching language processors correctly. This can cause content in foreign languages to be pronounced using the wrong language rules, making it incomprehensible. For example, French text might be read with English pronunciation rules. Users expect language changes to be handled smoothly, and invalid codes break this functionality.
Who it affects: Multilingual screen reader users who need proper language switching, users reading content in multiple languages, users with reading disabilities using assistive tools, and users relying on proper pronunciation for comprehension
How to fix: Verify all lang attributes on elements use valid ISO 639 language codes. Common fixes include correcting typos ("fre" → "fr"), using standard codes instead of full names ("French" → "fr"), and ensuring region codes are properly formatted ("en-us" → "en-US"). Test with screen readers to ensure language changes are announced and pronounced correctly.

Description: Link opens in new window/tab without warning users
Why it matters: Unexpectedly opening new windows can disorient users, especially those using screen readers or magnification. Users may not realize a new window opened and become confused when the back button doesn't work. This is particularly problematic for users with cognitive disabilities or those unfamiliar with browser behaviors.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not notice the context change, users with cognitive disabilities who may become disoriented, users with motor disabilities who have difficulty managing multiple windows, and novice computer users
How to fix: Add visible text or an icon indicating the link opens in a new window. Include this information in the accessible name (e.g., "Annual report (opens in new window)"). Consider whether opening in a new window is necessary - often it's better to open in the same window and let users control this behavior.

WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link text does not adequately describe the link's destination or purpose
Why it matters: Users need to understand where a link will take them before activating it. Vague link text like "click here" or "read more" provides no information about the destination. Screen reader users often navigate by pulling up a list of all links, where non-descriptive text becomes meaningless out of context.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by links list, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear navigation cues, and users with motor disabilities who need to make informed decisions before activating links
How to fix: Write link text that describes the destination or action (e.g., "Download 2024 annual report" instead of "Download"). Avoid generic phrases. If design constraints require short link text, provide additional context through aria-label or aria-describedby, or ensure surrounding text provides context.

Why it matters: Links and buttons have different behaviors - links navigate to new locations while buttons trigger actions. When links look like buttons, users may have incorrect expectations about what will happen. Keyboard users expect Space key to activate buttons but it doesn't work on links.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who expect button behavior, screen reader users who hear it announced as a link but see it as a button, and users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent interactions
How to fix: If the element performs an action (submit form, open dialog), use a button element. If it navigates to a new URL, keep it as a link but consider whether button styling is appropriate. Ensure keyboard behavior matches the element type.

Description: Page has no <title> element in the document head
Why it matters: The page title is the first thing screen reader users hear when a page loads, and it appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and search results. Without a title, users cannot identify the page in their browser history, distinguish between multiple open tabs, or understand what page they're on when arriving from a link. Screen reader users announcing "Untitled document" have no context about where they are. This is like opening a book with no title on the cover or spine - you don't know what you're reading until you dive into the content. The title is critical for orientation and navigation.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who rely on titles for page identification and orientation, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear page identification, users managing multiple browser tabs who need to distinguish between pages, users with memory issues using browser history to return to pages, and all users when bookmarking or sharing pages
How to fix: Add a <title> element within the <head> section of your HTML. Create descriptive, unique titles that identify both the page content and the site. Use a consistent pattern like "Page Topic - Site Name". Put the unique page information first since it's most important. Keep titles concise (under 60 characters) but descriptive. Avoid generic titles like "Home" or "Page 1". The title should make sense when read out of context in a list of bookmarks or search results.

Description: Inline SVG element detected that requires manual review to determine appropriate accessibility implementation based on its purpose and complexity
Why it matters: SVG elements serve diverse purposes from simple icons to complex interactive visualizations, each requiring different accessibility approaches. A decorative border needs different treatment than a data chart, which differs from an interactive map or scientific simulation. Automated tools cannot determine SVG purpose, whether it's decorative or informative, static or interactive, or if existing accessibility features adequately support user needs.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need text alternatives for graphics or keyboard access to interactive elements, users with motor disabilities who require keyboard navigation for interactive SVG controls, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clear labeling and predictable interaction patterns.
How to fix: Evaluate the SVG's purpose and complexity - for simple images ensure there is a role="img", use <title> for alt text with aria-labelledby on the SVG referencing an ID on the <title> (a workaround for some browsers), for decorative graphics use aria-hidden="true", for data visualizations provide <title> and <desc> plus consider adjacent detailed text alternatives, for interactive content ensure all controls are keyboard accessible with proper ARIA labels and focus management, for complex simulations provide instructions and state change announcements, and test with screen readers to verify the experience matches visual functionality.

Description: Iframe element is missing the required title attribute
Why it matters: Iframes embed external content like videos, maps, or forms within your page. Without a title attribute, screen reader users hear only "iframe" with no indication of what content it contains. This is like having a door with no label - users don't know what's behind it. They must enter the iframe and explore its content to understand its purpose, which is time-consuming and may be confusing if the iframe content lacks context. For pages with multiple iframes, users cannot distinguish between them or decide which ones are worth exploring.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need to understand what each iframe contains before deciding whether to interact with it, keyboard users navigating through iframes who need context about embedded content, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling of all page regions, and users on slow connections who may experience delays loading iframe content
How to fix: Add a title attribute to every iframe that concisely describes its content or purpose (e.g., title="YouTube video: Product demonstration", title="Google Maps: Office location", title="Payment form"). The title should be unique if there are multiple iframes. Keep it brief but descriptive enough that users understand what the iframe contains without having to enter it. For decorative iframes (rare), you can use title="" and add tabindex="-1" to remove it from tab order.

Description: Title attribute used - fundamentally inaccessible to assistive technology
Why it matters: Title attributes fail WCAG Conformance requirement 5.2.4 as they are not accessible with regular assistive technology. For screen magnifier users at high magnification, tooltip content extends off-screen and disappears when mouse moves to read it, making content completely inaccessible. Additionally, title attributes are not accessible on mobile/touch devices, inconsistently announced by screen readers, and cannot be accessed by keyboard-only users
Who it affects: Screen magnifier users (tooltip goes off-screen at high magnification), mobile and touch screen users (no hover), keyboard-only users (cannot trigger tooltip), screen reader users (inconsistent support), users with motor disabilities (tooltip disappears when mouse moves), users with cognitive disabilities (tooltip disappears too quickly)
How to fix: Never use title attributes. Use visible text, proper <label> elements for forms, aria-label for icons, or visible helper text. For abbreviations, provide full text on first use or use <dfn> element

Description: Iframe has a title attribute but it's generic or not descriptive (e.g., "iframe", "frame", "embedded content")
Why it matters: Generic iframe titles like "iframe" or "embedded" provide no useful information about the embedded content. Screen reader users hear these unhelpful titles and must enter the iframe to understand what it contains. With multiple iframes, users cannot distinguish between them or determine which ones are worth exploring. This wastes time and creates confusion, especially if iframes contain important functionality like payment forms or videos.
Who it affects: Screen reader users trying to understand and navigate between multiple iframes, keyboard users who encounter iframes in tab order, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling of all content regions, and users trying to navigate efficiently through complex pages
How to fix: Replace generic titles with descriptive ones that explain the iframe's content or purpose. Use specific descriptions like title="YouTube video: Product demo", title="Customer feedback form", title="Live chat support", or title="Interactive map of office locations". Each iframe title should be unique if there are multiple iframes. Avoid redundant words like "iframe" in the title since the element type is already announced.

Different browsers and assistive technologies may choose different titles from the {count} available, creating an inconsistent experience. SEO is negatively affected as search engines may index the wrong title.
Who it affects: All users seeing inconsistent titles in browser tabs, screen reader users who may hear different titles than what's visually displayed, users bookmarking pages with incorrect titles

The most important information might be at the end and never seen. Screen reader users have to listen to lengthy titles repeatedly.
Who it affects: Users with multiple tabs open who see truncated titles, users searching for content who can't see full titles in results, screen reader users who must listen to long titles repeatedly, mobile users with even less space for title display
How to fix: Shorten the title from {length} to under 60 characters. Place the most important, unique information first. Remove unnecessary words like "Welcome to" or "This page contains". Test how titles appear in browser tabs and search results to ensure key information is visible.

Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Page title "{found}" is only {length} characters, potentially not descriptive enough
Why it matters: The title "{found}" with only {length} characters doesn't provide enough context, especially when users have multiple tabs open or are browsing history. Users can't distinguish between different sites with the same generic titles. Screen reader users hearing page titles announced need more descriptive information to understand where they are.
Who it affects: Users with multiple browser tabs who need to distinguish between pages, screen reader users who rely on descriptive titles for context, users browsing history or bookmarks, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear page identification
How to fix: Expand "{found}" to be more descriptive by including the site name and page purpose. Aim for 20-60 characters that clearly describe the page content. Ensure each page has a unique, descriptive title that makes sense out of context.
