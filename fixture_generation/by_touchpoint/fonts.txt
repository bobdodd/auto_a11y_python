## WarnFontsizeIsBelow16px

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: WarnFontsizeIsBelow16px
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.4.4
Touchpoint: fonts
Description: Font size is {fontSize}px, below recommended 16px minimum
Why it matters: Text at {fontSize}px is harder to read than the recommended minimum of 16px. Small text requires more effort to read and can cause eye strain, especially for extended reading.

How to fix: Increase font size from {fontSize}px to at least 16px for body text. Consider using relative units (rem, em) for better scalability.
