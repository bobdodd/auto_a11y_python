                 data-violation-reason="Text-align: justify makes reading difficult for users with cognitive disabilities. Irregular word spacing creates visual 'rivers' that disrupt comprehension. Dyslexic users particularly struggle with justified text. Better to use left-aligned text for improved readability">
                <p>Remote work has transformed from a rare benefit to a standard practice in many industries. This shift has brought both opportunities and challenges as organizations adapt to distributed teams.</p>
