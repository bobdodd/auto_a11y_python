<h4>1. Aside region incorrectly placed</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"We've got what looks like an aside up here. I don't know exactly where that aside is. I don't know whether it's before the header. I don't know whether it's containing the header. We're going to have to use screen reader navigation and other tools to look at this in more detail. But I will just say that that is not a proper place for an aside region to be, so that's already an issue that I would flag."</p>

<h4>2. Navigation regions lack labels</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"We have what looks like, I think, two nav regions, but the problem we have with the nav regions is they do not appear to be labeled. Now when you have more than one nav region on a site, they have to have unique labels and those labels need to describe the nav purpose."</p>

<h4>3. Duplicate search roles</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"We have what looks like two search roles. I'm not quite sure what's going on there, but it looks like we only have one search region. So it would only be appropriate to have the search role on one container around that search region."</p>

<h4>4. Green on blue color contrast failure</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"Unfortunately, what we do see here is that this text color combination does not pass for regular text, which is text that is below 24 pixels or bold and below 18.5 pixels or the equivalent."</p>

<h4>5. Hover state button color contrast failure</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"That is a fail both for regular text and for large text. So even if we increase the size of those green links to meet contrast against the blue background, that green and white color combination will never pass color contrast under any part of the standard."</p>

<h4>6. Missing or inadequate focus indicators</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"I can't tell if there is a focus ring around it. But if there is, it is so low contrast that it's invisible. Now for sighted users navigating by keyboard, we have to have highly visible focus indicators for any element that received focus."</p>

<h4>8. Dropdown menus not keyboard accessible</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"We have a major problem with this menu, and that is that our drop down menus are not keyboard operable. So right now, I am focused, I think, on, let's see, the news menu link. So if I hit enter, nothing happens. No drop down appears."</p>

<h4>9. No visual indication of dropdown menus</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>

<h4>10. Placeholder used instead of visible label</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"Placeholders cannot be used as substitutes for visible labels because the problem with placeholders is that once you start typing into the input, your label disappears."</p>

<h4>11. Search button focus order incorrect</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"Our visual layout and our focus order are reversed. So what happens is I'm right now focused on the search input, and we can see that because my input that I typed in, the d text, is highlighted. So I've got that magnifying glass, what I guess now is a button, to the left of the input. So normally, what I would expect is that I should be able to shift tab to go backward because right to left is backward in the focus order to focus that button."</p>

<h4>12. Title attributes used inappropriately</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"Title attributes are bad news for accessibility. There are many, many reasons for that. You never want to use the title attribute on anything except for iframes where it is a requirement to provide the accessible name of an iframe."</p>

<h4>13. Confusing search behavior on keyboard navigation</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"We shouldn't be hiding and showing things when they receive focus. That's not really a good behavior to be doing."</p>

<h4>14. Text color contrast failure in search input</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"We have a major color contrast issue with our text in that input. It's what looks like kind of gray on the blue background. It's just not basically visible at all."</p>

<h4>15. Focus indicators delayed or inconsistent</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"I think that outlines are being done in some nonstandard way. What you wanna do is you just wanna provide a CSS outline property, and you don't wanna add any delays."</p>

<h4>16. Footer menu items not marked as headings</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"Unfortunately, they are not. So whenever you have text that is visually formatted as a heading, you actually need to mark it as an HTML heading."</p>

<h4>17. Single item marked as list</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"Now when you have one item, you don't want to use list markup because by definition lists have to be more than one item. It's not a list if it's one thing."</p>

<h4>18. Empty list markup present</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"And then down here we've got an empty unordered list and some empty list items. So we wanna remove that. We wanna always remove any empty semantic markup on a page because that can actually be exposed to screen reader users."</p>

<h4>19. Links need underlines in body text</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"Technically, this doesn't meet the standard because the technique that describes meeting the standard says that the link has to receive an underline or hover in focus, and it has to have a color difference that has a contrast of at least three to one with the nonlinked text."</p>

<h4>20. Footer focus indicators inadequate</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"When I first tab to a link, it gets a blue outline, which does not have sufficient color contrast with the gray background. And then after a delay, we get a sufficient focus indicator that is black and white."</p>

<h4>21. Missing skip to main content link</h4>

<h4>22. Logo link has no accessible text</h4>

<h4>23. All caps text reduces readability</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
<p>"All caps text is more difficult for people to read, and that especially goes for people with reading disabilities like dyslexia because you don't have the kind of ascenders and descenders, the parts that stick up and down above and below the line that helps people recognize the shapes of letters and shapes of words and read words."</p>

<h4>25. Search functionality extremely confusing</h4>
<h5>Text Spoken</h5>
