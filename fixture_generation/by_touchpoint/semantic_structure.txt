# SEMANTIC_STRUCTURE Touchpoint

Total issues: 4

================================================================================

## ErrHeaderMissingScope

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Tables/ErrHeaderMissingScope.html

ID: ErrHeaderMissingScope
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: semantic_structure
Description: Table header (th) element missing scope attribute
Why it matters: Without scope attributes, screen readers cannot properly associate headers with data cells, making tables difficult to understand.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating complex tables, users who rely on proper table semantics for comprehension.
How to fix: Add scope="col" for column headers and scope="row" for row headers to all th elements.

================================================================================

## ErrImproperTitleAttribute

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: ErrImproperTitleAttribute
Type: Error
Impact: Low
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: semantic_structure
Description: Title attribute used improperly as primary labeling mechanism
Why it matters: Title attributes are not reliably announced by all assistive technologies and should not be the only way to provide essential information.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not receive title attribute content, mobile users who cannot hover to see tooltips.
How to fix: Use proper labeling techniques (label elements, aria-label) instead of relying on title attributes for essential information.

Description: Visual hierarchy doesn't match semantic structure
Why it matters: Mismatch between visual and semantic structure confuses understanding.
