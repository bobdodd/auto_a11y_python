Image Placeholder Files

For the demo, you'll need these images:
- quebec-logo.svg (Quebec government logo)
- hero1.jpg, hero2.jpg, hero3.jpg (Hero carousel images)
- service1.svg, service2.svg, service3.svg (Service icons)

The demo will work without these files, but placeholders will be shown.
You can use any relevant images or create simple SVG placeholders.

Note: The logo image has an empty alt attribute (alt="") which is intentional
to demonstrate proper decorative image handling.
