# HEADINGS Touchpoint

Total issues: 20

================================================================================

## AI_ErrHeadingLevelMismatch

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: AI_ErrHeadingLevelMismatch
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 2.4.1
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading level {current_level} doesn't match visual hierarchy (should be level {suggested_level})
Why it matters: Incorrect heading levels create confusing document structure for screen reader users
Who it affects: Screen reader users, users who navigate by headings
How to fix: Adjust heading level to match the visual hierarchy of the page

================================================================================

## AI_ErrSkippedHeading

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: AI_ErrSkippedHeading
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading level skipped from h{current_level} to h{next_level}
Why it matters: Skipped heading levels break the logical document structure and make navigation difficult
Who it affects: Screen reader users, users who navigate by headings
How to fix: Use sequential heading levels without skipping (h1, h2, h3, not h1, h3)

================================================================================

## AI_ErrVisualHeadingNotMarked

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: AI_ErrVisualHeadingNotMarked
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1, 2.4.1, 2.4.6
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Text "{visual_text}" appears visually as a heading but is not marked up with proper heading tags
Why it matters: Screen reader users won't recognize this text as a heading, breaking navigation and document structure
Who it affects: Screen reader users, users who navigate by headings
How to fix: Use appropriate HTML heading tags (h1-h6) for text that serves as headings

================================================================================

## ErrEmptyHeading

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrEmptyHeading.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrEmptyHeading_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrEmptyHeading_002_correct_with_text.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrEmptyHeading_003_edge_image_only.html

ID: ErrEmptyHeading
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading element contains only whitespace or special characters: "{text}"
Why it matters: This heading contains only "{text}" which provides no meaningful content. Empty headings disrupt document structure and navigation. Screen reader users rely on headings to understand page organization and navigate efficiently using heading shortcuts. An empty heading creates a navigation point with no information, confusing users about the page structure.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by headings and find a heading containing only "{text}", users with cognitive disabilities who rely on clear structure to understand content organization, and users of assistive technologies that generate page outlines
How to fix: Either replace "{text}" with meaningful text content that describes the section, or remove the empty heading element entirely if it serves no structural purpose. Never use headings for visual spacing - use CSS margin/padding instead.

## ErrFoundAriaLevelButNoRoleAppliedAtAll

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrFoundAriaLevelButNoRoleAppliedAtAll_002_correct_with_role.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrFoundAriaLevelButNoRoleAppliedAtAll_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/ARIA/ErrFoundAriaLevelButNoRoleAppliedAtAll.html

ID: ErrFoundAriaLevelButNoRoleAppliedAtAll
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1, 4.1.2
Touchpoint: headings
Description: aria-level attribute without role="heading"
Why it matters: aria-level only works with heading role
Who it affects: Screen reader users
How to fix: Add role="heading" or use native heading element

================================================================================

## ErrFoundAriaLevelButRoleIsNotHeading

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrFoundAriaLevelButRoleIsNotHeading_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrFoundAriaLevelButRoleIsNotHeading_002_correct_heading_role.html

ID: ErrFoundAriaLevelButRoleIsNotHeading
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1, 4.1.2
Touchpoint: headings
Description: aria-level on element without heading role
Why it matters: aria-level requires heading role to work
Who it affects: Screen reader users
How to fix: Add role="heading" or remove aria-level

================================================================================

## ErrIncorrectHeadingLevel

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrIncorrectHeadingLevel.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrIncorrectHeadingLevel_002_correct_css_styled.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrIncorrectHeadingLevel_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrIncorrectHeadingLevel
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading level used incorrectly based on visual appearance rather than document structure
Why it matters: Incorrect heading levels break the document outline and make it difficult to understand content hierarchy.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by headings, users who rely on proper document structure.
How to fix: Use heading levels to convey document structure (h1 > h2 > h3), not for visual styling; use CSS for appearance.

================================================================================

## ErrInvalidAriaLevel

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrInvalidAriaLevel_002_correct_valid_levels.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrInvalidAriaLevel_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrInvalidAriaLevel
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 4.1.2
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Invalid aria-level value (not 1-6)
Why it matters: Invalid levels break heading hierarchy
Who it affects: Screen reader users
How to fix: Use aria-level values 1 through 6 only

================================================================================

## ErrMultipleH1

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrMultipleH1.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrMultipleH1_002_correct_single_h1.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrMultipleH1_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrMultipleH1
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Page contains {count} h1 elements instead of just one
Why it matters: Having {count} h1 elements creates confusion about the page's main topic. Each h1 represents a primary heading, and multiple h1s suggest multiple main topics, breaking the document hierarchy. Screen readers users won't know which h1 represents the actual page topic.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who expect a single h1 to identify the page topic, users navigating by headings who see multiple "top level" items, SEO and search engines that look for a single main topic
How to fix: Keep only one h1 that represents the main page topic. Change the other h1 elements to h2 or appropriate lower levels based on their relationship to the main topic.

================================================================================

## ErrNoH1

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrNoH1_002_correct_with_h1.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrNoH1_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrNoH1_003_aria_heading.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrNoH1.html

ID: ErrNoH1
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Page has no h1 heading
Why it matters: H1 headings identify the main topic of a page and are crucial for document structure.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by headings, users who rely on document outlines.
How to fix: Add exactly one h1 heading that describes the main content or purpose of the page.

================================================================================

## ErrNoHeadingsOnPage

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrNoHeadingsOnPage_002_correct_with_headings.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrNoHeadingsOnPage_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrNoHeadingsOnPage
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: No heading elements (h1-h6) found anywhere on the page
Why it matters: Headings create the structural outline of your content, like a table of contents. They allow users to understand how information is organized and navigate directly to sections of interest. Without any headings, screen reader users cannot use heading navigation shortcuts (one of their primary navigation methods) and must read through all content linearly. This is like forcing someone to read an entire book without chapter titles or section breaks. Users cannot skim content, jump to relevant sections, or understand the information hierarchy. For users with cognitive disabilities, the lack of visual structure makes content overwhelming and hard to process.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who lose a critical navigation method and cannot understand content structure, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear visual organization to process information, users with attention disorders who rely on headings to focus on relevant sections, and users with reading disabilities who use headings to break content into manageable chunks
How to fix: Add semantic heading elements (h1-h6) to structure your content. Start with one h1 that describes the main page topic. Use h2 for major sections, h3 for subsections, and so on. Don't skip levels (e.g., h1 to h3). Ensure headings describe the content that follows them. Never use headings just for visual styling - they must represent actual content structure. If you need large text without semantic meaning, use CSS instead.

================================================================================

## ErrRoleOfHeadingButNoLevelGiven

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrRoleOfHeadingButNoLevelGiven_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrRoleOfHeadingButNoLevelGiven_002_correct_with_level.html

ID: ErrRoleOfHeadingButNoLevelGiven
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 4.1.2
Touchpoint: headings
Description: role="heading" without aria-level
Why it matters: Heading level is undefined
Who it affects: Screen reader users
How to fix: Add aria-level attribute with value 1-6

================================================================================

## ErrHeadingOrder

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrHeadingOrder_002_correct_logical_order.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrHeadingOrder_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrHeadingOrder
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Headings appear in illogical order - high-level headings (H1, H2) appear after lower-level headings (H3, H4, H5, H6)
Why it matters: Document structure should be logical and predictable. When high-level headings like H1 or H2 appear after lower-level headings, it creates a backwards or inverted hierarchy. This is like reading a book where chapter titles appear after section headings, or where the main title appears at the end. Screen reader users navigating by headings expect the most important headings first, followed by progressively more detailed subsections. When headings appear out of logical order, users cannot understand the content structure, may miss important navigation landmarks, and cannot build an accurate mental model of how the page is organized.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who rely on heading navigation and expect logical document structure, users with cognitive disabilities who need predictable content organization, users who generate document outlines from headings, and users who navigate by heading levels to understand content hierarchy
How to fix: Restructure your content so that high-level headings (H1, H2) appear before lower-level headings. Start with H1 for the main page title, then H2 for major sections, then H3 for subsections within those. Headings should appear in a logical, top-down hierarchy that matches how users would naturally read and understand the content structure.

================================================================================

## ErrSkippedHeadingLevel

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrSkippedHeadingLevel.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrSkippedHeadingLevel_002_correct_sequential.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrSkippedHeadingLevel_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrSkippedHeadingLevel
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading levels are not in sequential order - jumped from h{skippedFrom} to h{skippedTo}, skipping intermediate level(s)
Why it matters: Heading levels create a hierarchical outline of your content, like nested bullet points. Jumping from h{skippedFrom} to h{skippedTo} breaks this logical structure. It's like having chapter {skippedFrom}, then jumping to section {skippedTo} without the intermediate section. Screen reader users navigating by headings will be confused about the relationship between sections - is the h{skippedTo} a subsection of something that's missing? This broken hierarchy makes it hard to understand how content is organized and can cause users to think content is missing or that they've accidentally skipped something.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by heading structure who rely on levels to understand content relationships, users with cognitive disabilities who need logical, predictable content organization, users of assistive technology that generates document outlines, and developers or content authors maintaining the page who need to understand the intended structure
How to fix: Insert an h{expectedLevel} heading between the h{skippedFrom} and h{skippedTo}, or change the h{skippedTo} to h{expectedLevel} to maintain sequential order. After h{skippedFrom}, use h{expectedLevel} for the next level. Don't skip levels when going down the hierarchy. If you need a heading to look smaller visually, use CSS to style it rather than choosing a lower heading level. The heading level should reflect the content's logical structure, not its visual appearance.

## InfoHeadingNearLengthLimit

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/InfoHeadingNearLengthLimit_002_correct_short.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/InfoHeadingNearLengthLimit.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/InfoHeadingNearLengthLimit_001_violations_basic.html

ID: InfoHeadingNearLengthLimit
Type: Info
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading approaching recommended length limit
Why it matters: Very long headings are difficult to scan and understand quickly.
Who it affects: Users with cognitive disabilities, users scanning content.
How to fix: Consider shortening headings to be more concise while maintaining clarity.

================================================================================

## ErrHeadingAccessibleNameMismatch

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrHeadingAccessibleNameMismatch_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/ErrHeadingAccessibleNameMismatch_002_correct_matching.html

ID: ErrHeadingAccessibleNameMismatch
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.5.3
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Visible heading text doesn't match its accessible name
Why it matters: Voice control users may not be able to reference the heading by its visible text
Who it affects: Voice control users, screen reader users
How to fix: Ensure visible text starts the accessible name (e.g., visible 'Support' should be at the start of aria-label, like 'Support: Customer Service')

================================================================================

## WarnHeadingInsideDisplayNone

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/WarnHeadingInsideDisplayNone_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/WarnHeadingInsideDisplayNone_002_correct_visible.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/WarnHeadingInsideDisplayNone.html

ID: WarnHeadingInsideDisplayNone
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading is hidden with display:none
Why it matters: Hidden headings may affect document structure
Who it affects: Screen reader users (varies by implementation)
How to fix: Remove unused headings or make them visible

================================================================================

## WarnHeadingOver60CharsLong

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/WarnHeadingOver60CharsLong_002_correct_concise.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/WarnHeadingOver60CharsLong.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/WarnHeadingOver60CharsLong_001_violations_basic.html

ID: WarnHeadingOver60CharsLong
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.6
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading text is {length} characters long: "{headingText}"
Why it matters: This heading has {length} characters. Long headings are harder to scan quickly, more difficult to understand at a glance, and can overwhelm users. Screen reader users hearing the full heading text may struggle to grasp the main point. Long headings also cause layout issues on mobile devices and in navigation menus.
Who it affects: Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from concise, clear headings, screen reader users who must listen to the entire heading, users scanning the page quickly for information, and mobile users with limited screen space
How to fix: Shorten the heading to under 60 characters while preserving its meaning. Current: "{headingText}" - Consider breaking into a shorter heading with explanatory text below, or focus on the key message. Use descriptive but concise language.

================================================================================

## DiscoHeadingWithID

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Headings/DiscoHeadingWithID_001_discovery_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Headings/DiscoHeadingWithID.html

ID: DiscoHeadingWithID
Type: Discovery
Impact: N/A
WCAG: N/A
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Heading element has an ID attribute that may be used for in-page navigation
Why it matters: Headings with IDs are often link targets for navigation, requiring verification that they work correctly and provide meaningful navigation points.
Who it affects: All users who use in-page navigation links, screen reader users who navigate by headings, keyboard users who follow fragment links.
How to fix: Ensure that the ID attribute is referenced and its use is valid.
