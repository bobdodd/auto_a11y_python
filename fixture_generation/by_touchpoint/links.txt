## ErrInvalidGenericLinkName

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: ErrInvalidGenericLinkName
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link text is generic and provides no information about destination
Why it matters: Generic link text like "click here" provides no context when links are reviewed out of context.

## ErrLinkOpensNewWindowNoWarning

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Links/ErrLinkOpensNewWindowNoWarning_002_correct_with_warning.html
  - Fixtures/Links/ErrLinkOpensNewWindowNoWarning_001_violations_basic.html

ID: ErrLinkOpensNewWindowNoWarning
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 3.2.2 On Input
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link opens in new window/tab without warning users
Why it matters: Unexpectedly opening new windows can disorient users, especially those using screen readers or magnification. Users may not realize a new window opened and become confused when the back button doesn't work. This is particularly problematic for users with cognitive disabilities or those unfamiliar with browser behaviors.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not notice the context change, users with cognitive disabilities who may become disoriented, users with motor disabilities who have difficulty managing multiple windows, and novice computer users
How to fix: Add visible text or an icon indicating the link opens in a new window. Include this information in the accessible name (e.g., "Annual report (opens in new window)"). Consider whether opening in a new window is necessary - often it's better to open in the same window and let users control this behavior.

## ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Links/ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive_003_correct_with_aria_label.html
  - Fixtures/Links/ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Links/ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive_002_correct_descriptive.html

ID: ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link text does not adequately describe the link's destination or purpose
Why it matters: Users need to understand where a link will take them before activating it. Vague link text like "click here" or "read more" provides no information about the destination. Screen reader users often navigate by pulling up a list of all links, where non-descriptive text becomes meaningless out of context.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by links list, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear navigation cues, and users with motor disabilities who need to make informed decisions before activating links
How to fix: Write link text that describes the destination or action (e.g., "Download 2024 annual report" instead of "Download"). Avoid generic phrases. If design constraints require short link text, provide additional context through aria-label or aria-describedby, or ensure surrounding text provides context.

================================================================================

## WarnAnchorTargetTabindex

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: WarnAnchorTargetTabindex
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Anchor target element has unnecessary tabindex
Why it matters: Elements that are link targets don't need tabindex; adding it may create confusion.
Who it affects: Keyboard users encountering unexpected tab stops.
How to fix: Remove tabindex from elements that are only link targets, not interactive controls.

================================================================================

## WarnGenericLinkNoImprovement

✨ New fixtures needed

ID: WarnGenericLinkNoImprovement
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Generic link text with no surrounding context to clarify purpose
Why it matters: Generic links without context force users to explore further to understand destinations.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by links, users with cognitive disabilities.
How to fix: Rewrite link text to be descriptive, or ensure surrounding text provides clear context.

================================================================================

## WarnLinkLooksLikeButton

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Links/WarnLinkLooksLikeButton_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Links/WarnLinkLooksLikeButton.html
  - Fixtures/Links/WarnLinkLooksLikeButton_002_correct_semantic_elements.html

ID: WarnLinkLooksLikeButton
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link is styled to look like a button but uses anchor element
Why it matters: Links and buttons have different behaviors - links navigate to new locations while buttons trigger actions. When links look like buttons, users may have incorrect expectations about what will happen. Keyboard users expect Space key to activate buttons but it doesn't work on links.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who expect button behavior, screen reader users who hear it announced as a link but see it as a button, and users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent interactions
How to fix: If the element performs an action (submit form, open dialog), use a button element. If it navigates to a new URL, keep it as a link but consider whether button styling is appropriate. Ensure keyboard behavior matches the element type.
