## ErrIframeWithNoTitleAttr

ID: ErrIframeWithNoTitleAttr
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks, 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
Touchpoint: title
Description: Iframe element is missing the required title attribute
Why it matters: Iframes embed external content like videos, maps, or forms within your page. Without a title attribute, screen reader users hear only "iframe" with no indication of what content it contains. This is like having a door with no label - users don't know what's behind it. They must enter the iframe and explore its content to understand its purpose, which is time-consuming and may be confusing if the iframe content lacks context. For pages with multiple iframes, users cannot distinguish between them or decide which ones are worth exploring.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need to understand what each iframe contains before deciding whether to interact with it, keyboard users navigating through iframes who need context about embedded content, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling of all page regions, and users on slow connections who may experience delays loading iframe content
How to fix: Add a title attribute to every iframe that concisely describes its content or purpose (e.g., title="YouTube video: Product demonstration", title="Google Maps: Office location", title="Payment form"). The title should be unique if there are multiple iframes. Keep it brief but descriptive enough that users understand what the iframe contains without having to enter it. For decorative iframes (rare), you can use title="" and add tabindex="-1" to remove it from tab order.

================================================================================

## ErrImproperTitleAttribute

ID: ErrImproperTitleAttribute
Type: Error
Impact: Low
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: semantic_structure
Description: Title attribute used improperly as primary labeling mechanism
Why it matters: Title attributes are not reliably announced by all assistive technologies and should not be the only way to provide essential information.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not receive title attribute content, mobile users who cannot hover to see tooltips.
How to fix: Use proper labeling techniques (label elements, aria-label) instead of relying on title attributes for essential information.

================================================================================

## ErrInappropriateMenuRole

ID: ErrInappropriateMenuRole
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: navigation
Description: Menu role used inappropriately for navigation links
Why it matters: Menu role is for application menus, not navigation. Misuse causes incorrect keyboard behavior and screen reader announcements.
Who it affects: Screen reader users expecting application menu behavior, keyboard users expecting arrow key navigation.
How to fix: Use nav element or role="navigation" for site navigation, reserve role="menu" for actual application menus with proper ARIA patterns.

================================================================================

ID: ErrInvalidAriaLevel
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 4.1.2

================================================================================

## ErrInvalidLanguageCode

ID: ErrInvalidLanguageCode
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A), 3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA)
Touchpoint: language
Description: Language attribute contains invalid code '{found}' that doesn't conform to ISO 639 standards
Why it matters: The language code '{found}' is not recognized as a valid ISO 639 language code. This prevents assistive technologies from properly processing content, causing screen readers to mispronounce words, use incorrect inflection patterns, or fail to switch language engines. This can make content difficult or impossible to understand when read aloud, especially if the content is in a non-English language but gets read with English pronunciation rules.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users relying on screen readers for accurate pronunciation, multilingual users who need proper language identification for comprehension, users with reading disabilities using text-to-speech tools, and international users accessing content in multiple languages
How to fix: Replace '{found}' with a valid ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 language code. If '{found}' appears to be English, use "en". Common corrections: "english" → "en", "spanish" → "es", "french" → "fr", "deutsch" → "de", "eng" → "en". For regional variants use BCP 47 format (e.g., "en-US", "en-GB", "es-MX"). Check the official ISO 639 registry for the correct code.

================================================================================

## ErrInvalidTabindex

ID: ErrInvalidTabindex
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Element has a tabindex attribute with an invalid value (non-numeric or decimal)
Why it matters: Invalid tabindex values are ignored by browsers, potentially making interactive elements unreachable by keyboard or creating unpredictable focus behavior. This can completely block keyboard users from accessing functionality. The element might be skipped during tabbing, receive focus unexpectedly, or behave differently across browsers.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who cannot reach or interact with the element, screen reader users who may miss important interactive controls, users with motor disabilities relying on keyboard navigation, and users who cannot use a mouse
How to fix: Use only valid integer values for tabindex: "0" to include in natural tab order, "-1" to remove from tab order but allow programmatic focus, or remove the tabindex attribute entirely if the element shouldn't be focusable. Never use decimal values (1.5), text ("first"), or empty values (tabindex="").

================================================================================

## ErrLinkOpensNewWindowNoWarning

ID: ErrLinkOpensNewWindowNoWarning
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 3.2.2 On Input
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link opens in new window/tab without warning users
Why it matters: Unexpectedly opening new windows can disorient users, especially those using screen readers or magnification. Users may not realize a new window opened and become confused when the back button doesn't work. This is particularly problematic for users with cognitive disabilities or those unfamiliar with browser behaviors.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not notice the context change, users with cognitive disabilities who may become disoriented, users with motor disabilities who have difficulty managing multiple windows, and novice computer users
How to fix: Add visible text or an icon indicating the link opens in a new window. Include this information in the accessible name (e.g., "Annual report (opens in new window)"). Consider whether opening in a new window is necessary - often it's better to open in the same window and let users control this behavior.

================================================================================

## ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive

ID: ErrLinkTextNotDescriptive
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)
Touchpoint: links
Description: Link text does not adequately describe the link's destination or purpose
Why it matters: Users need to understand where a link will take them before activating it. Vague link text like "click here" or "read more" provides no information about the destination. Screen reader users often navigate by pulling up a list of all links, where non-descriptive text becomes meaningless out of context.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by links list, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear navigation cues, and users with motor disabilities who need to make informed decisions before activating links
How to fix: Write link text that describes the destination or action (e.g., "Download 2024 annual report" instead of "Download"). Avoid generic phrases. If design constraints require short link text, provide additional context through aria-label or aria-describedby, or ensure surrounding text provides context.

## ErrMultipleMainLandmarks

ID: ErrMultipleMainLandmarks
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Multiple main landmark regions found on the page
Why it matters: The main landmark should contain THE primary content of the page - having multiple main landmarks is like having multiple "Chapter 1" sections in a book. It confuses the page structure and defeats the purpose of landmarks. Screen reader users expecting to jump to the main content won't know which landmark contains the actual primary content. They might land in the wrong section, miss important content, or have to check multiple "main" areas. This ambiguity makes the landmark system unreliable and forces users back to linear navigation.
Who it affects: Screen reader users relying on the main landmark to skip to primary content, keyboard users using landmark navigation extensions, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear, unambiguous page structure, and developers trying to understand the intended page structure
How to fix: Use only one <main> element or role="main" per page. Identify which content is truly the primary, unique content for that page and wrap only that in the main landmark. If you have multiple important sections, use other appropriate landmarks (article, section) or headings to structure them within the single main landmark. The main should contain all unique page content but exclude repeated elements like headers, navigation, and footers.

## ErrNoBannerLandmarkOnPage

ID: ErrNoBannerLandmarkOnPage
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a banner landmark to identify the site header region
Why it matters: The banner landmark identifies the site header which typically contains the site logo, main navigation, and search functionality. This content appears consistently across pages and users expect to find it at the top. Without proper banner markup, screen reader users cannot quickly jump to the header area using landmark navigation shortcuts. They must instead navigate through all content linearly or guess where the header content begins and ends. This makes it difficult to access primary navigation or return to the site homepage via the logo link, tasks that sighted users can do instantly by looking at the top of the page.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who use landmark navigation to quickly access site navigation and branding, keyboard users who want to efficiently navigate to header elements, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure to orient themselves, and users with low vision using screen magnifiers who need to quickly locate navigation elements
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <header> element for your site header (it has an implicit role of banner when it's not nested inside article, aside, main, nav, or section elements). Alternatively, add role="banner" to the container holding your header content. There should typically be only one banner landmark per page at the top level. Include site-wide content like logo, primary navigation, and site search within the banner landmark.

## ErrNoHeadingsOnPage

ID: ErrNoHeadingsOnPage
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: No heading elements (h1-h6) found anywhere on the page
Why it matters: Headings create the structural outline of your content, like a table of contents. They allow users to understand how information is organized and navigate directly to sections of interest. Without any headings, screen reader users cannot use heading navigation shortcuts (one of their primary navigation methods) and must read through all content linearly. This is like forcing someone to read an entire book without chapter titles or section breaks. Users cannot skim content, jump to relevant sections, or understand the information hierarchy. For users with cognitive disabilities, the lack of visual structure makes content overwhelming and hard to process.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who lose a critical navigation method and cannot understand content structure, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear visual organization to process information, users with attention disorders who rely on headings to focus on relevant sections, and users with reading disabilities who use headings to break content into manageable chunks
How to fix: Add semantic heading elements (h1-h6) to structure your content. Start with one h1 that describes the main page topic. Use h2 for major sections, h3 for subsections, and so on. Don't skip levels (e.g., h1 to h3). Ensure headings describe the content that follows them. Never use headings just for visual styling - they must represent actual content structure. If you need large text without semantic meaning, use CSS instead.

================================================================================

## ErrNoMainLandmark

ID: ErrNoMainLandmark
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a main landmark region to identify the primary content area
Why it matters: Screen reader users rely on landmarks to understand page layout and quickly navigate to important sections. The main landmark allows users to skip repeated content like headers and navigation to jump directly to the unique page content. Without it, users must navigate through all repeated elements on every page, which is time-consuming and frustrating. The main landmark should contain all content that is unique to the page, including the h1 heading.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who navigate by landmarks, users with motor disabilities who need efficient keyboard navigation to skip repeated content, and users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from clear page structure
How to fix: Add a <main> element around the primary content area, or use role="main" on an appropriate container element. Ensure there is only one main landmark per page, position it as a top-level landmark (not nested inside other landmarks), and include all unique page content within it, including the h1 heading. The main landmark should not include repeated content like site headers, navigation, or footers.

## ErrNoPageLanguage

ID: ErrNoPageLanguage
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)
Touchpoint: language
Description: HTML element is missing the lang attribute, preventing assistive technologies from determining the primary language of the page
Why it matters: Without a declared language, screen readers cannot determine which pronunciation rules and voice synthesizer to use, often defaulting to the user's system language which may be incorrect. This causes mispronunciation, incorrect inflection, and can make content unintelligible, especially for pages in languages different from the user's default settings.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who need correct pronunciation for comprehension, international users accessing content in different languages, users with dyslexia or reading disabilities using assistive reading tools, and users of automatic translation services
How to fix: Add the lang attribute to the <html> element with the appropriate language code (e.g., <html lang="en"> for English, <html lang="fr"> for French). Use ISO 639-1 two-letter codes for modern languages. For XHTML, also include xml:lang with the same value. Ensure the declared language matches the actual primary language of your content. For multilingual pages, use the language that represents the majority of the content.

================================================================================

## ErrNoPrimaryLangAttr

ID: ErrNoPrimaryLangAttr
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.1.1 Language of Page
Touchpoint: language
Description: HTML element is missing the required lang attribute to identify the page's primary language
Why it matters: Both assistive technologies and browsers render text more accurately when the language is identified. Screen readers need to know which language pronunciation rules to use - without this, they may mispronounce words, use wrong inflections, or attempt to read content in the wrong language entirely. This can make content completely incomprehensible. Visual browsers need language information to display characters and scripts correctly, and search engines use it for proper indexing.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may hear garbled pronunciation if the page language doesn't match their assistive technology's default language, users relying on automatic translation tools, users of voice assistants, and users with dyslexia using reading assistance tools
How to fix: Add the lang attribute to the html element with the appropriate ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., lang="en" for English, lang="es" for Spanish, lang="fr" for French). If the page uses multiple languages equally, use the language that appears first or is used for navigation.

## ErrTransparentFocusIndicator

ID: ErrTransparentFocusIndicator
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
Touchpoint: focus
Description: Focus indicator uses transparent or nearly transparent color, making it effectively invisible
Why it matters: A transparent focus indicator is functionally the same as no focus indicator - users cannot see where keyboard focus is located. This might occur from using rgba with 0 or very low alpha values, setting outline-color to transparent, or using colors that match the background. The focus indicator exists technically but provides no practical benefit to users trying to navigate.
Who it affects: Keyboard users who need visible focus indicators to navigate, users with low vision who need clear visual cues, users with color blindness who may already struggle with certain color combinations, and users with cognitive disabilities who need obvious focus indicators
How to fix: Use opaque colors with sufficient contrast for focus indicators. Replace transparent outlines with visible colors, ensure at least 3:1 contrast ratio between focus indicator and background, use solid colors or high alpha values (0.7 or higher) for rgba colors. Test focus indicators on different backgrounds across your site. Consider using box-shadow or background changes as additional focus indicators.

Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Important content found outside of any landmark region, making it harder for screen reader users to find and navigate to
Why it matters: Landmarks create a navigable structure for your page, like a table of contents. Content outside landmarks is like having chapters missing from the table of contents - users may never find it when navigating by landmarks. Screen reader users often jump between landmarks to quickly scan page structure, and content outside landmarks requires them to read through the entire page linearly to discover it. This particularly affects users who are familiar with your site and want to quickly navigate to specific content areas.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to efficiently explore pages, keyboard users using browser extensions for landmark navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and power users who use landmarks for quick navigation
How to fix: Ensure all meaningful content is contained within appropriate landmark regions. Typically: use <header> or role="banner" for site headers, <nav> or role="navigation" for navigation menus, <main> or role="main" for primary content, <aside> or role="complementary" for sidebar content, <footer> or role="contentinfo" for footers. Decorative content or spacers can remain outside landmarks. Review your page structure to ensure no important content is orphaned outside the landmark structure.

Touchpoint: title
Description: Iframe has a title attribute but it's generic or not descriptive (e.g., "iframe", "frame", "embedded content")
Why it matters: Generic iframe titles like "iframe" or "embedded" provide no useful information about the embedded content. Screen reader users hear these unhelpful titles and must enter the iframe to understand what it contains. With multiple iframes, users cannot distinguish between them or determine which ones are worth exploring. This wastes time and creates confusion, especially if iframes contain important functionality like payment forms or videos.
Who it affects: Screen reader users trying to understand and navigate between multiple iframes, keyboard users who encounter iframes in tab order, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling of all content regions, and users trying to navigate efficiently through complex pages
How to fix: Replace generic titles with descriptive ones that explain the iframe's content or purpose. Use specific descriptions like title="YouTube video: Product demo", title="Customer feedback form", title="Live chat support", or title="Interactive map of office locations". Each iframe title should be unique if there are multiple iframes. Avoid redundant words like "iframe" in the title since the element type is already announced.

## WarnInvalidLangChange

ID: WarnInvalidLangChange
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA)
Touchpoint: language
Description: Language change indicated but with invalid or unrecognized language code
Why it matters: Invalid language codes on content sections prevent screen readers from switching language processors correctly. This can cause content in foreign languages to be pronounced using the wrong language rules, making it incomprehensible. For example, French text might be read with English pronunciation rules. Users expect language changes to be handled smoothly, and invalid codes break this functionality.
Who it affects: Multilingual screen reader users who need proper language switching, users reading content in multiple languages, users with reading disabilities using assistive tools, and users relying on proper pronunciation for comprehension
How to fix: Verify all lang attributes on elements use valid ISO 639 language codes. Common fixes include correcting typos ("fre" → "fr"), using standard codes instead of full names ("French" → "fr"), and ensuring region codes are properly formatted ("en-us" → "en-US"). Test with screen readers to ensure language changes are announced and pronounced correctly.

## WarnMultipleNavNeedsLabel

ID: WarnMultipleNavNeedsLabel
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Multiple navigation landmarks found without distinguishing labels
Why it matters: When a page has multiple navigation areas (main menu, footer links, breadcrumbs, sidebar navigation), users need to distinguish between them. Without unique labels, screen reader users hear "navigation" multiple times with no indication of which navigation area they're entering. This creates confusion about which menu contains the desired links and requires users to explore each navigation to understand its purpose.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need to distinguish between different navigation areas, keyboard users navigating between multiple menus, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labeling, and frequent users who want to quickly access specific navigation areas
How to fix: Add unique aria-label attributes to each <nav> element or role="navigation" container. Use descriptive labels like aria-label="Main menu", aria-label="Footer links", aria-label="Breadcrumb", aria-label="Related articles". The labels should clearly indicate the purpose or location of each navigation. Test with screen readers to ensure each navigation is announced with its unique label.

## WarnMultipleTitleElements

ID: WarnMultipleTitleElements
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: {count} <title> elements found in the document head, which may cause unpredictable behavior
Why it matters: Having {count} title elements causes browsers to choose unpredictably between them, creating inconsistent page identification. Different browsers and assistive technologies may choose different titles from the {count} available, creating an inconsistent experience. SEO is negatively affected as search engines may index the wrong title.
Who it affects: All users seeing inconsistent titles in browser tabs, screen reader users who may hear different titles than what's visually displayed, users bookmarking pages with incorrect titles
How to fix: Remove {count-1} duplicate <title> elements, keeping only one in the document head. Check for scripts that might be adding titles dynamically. Ensure your CMS or framework isn't creating duplicate titles.

## WarnNoBannerLandmark

ID: WarnNoBannerLandmark
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A), 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A)
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a banner landmark to identify the header/masthead region
Why it matters: The banner landmark identifies the site header containing the logo, primary navigation, and other site-wide content. Without it, screen reader users cannot quickly jump to the header area using landmark navigation. They must read through content linearly to find navigation and branding elements. This is especially frustrating when users want to access the main navigation or return to the homepage via the logo.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly access header content, keyboard users with assistive technology looking for navigation, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and users who frequently need to access header elements like search or main navigation
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <header> element at the page level (not within article, aside, main, nav, or section) as it has an implicit banner role. Alternatively, add role="banner" to your header container. Include site-wide elements like logo, primary navigation, site search, and utility navigation within the banner. Ensure only one banner landmark exists per page at the top level.

================================================================================

## WarnNoContentinfoLandmark

ID: WarnNoContentinfoLandmark
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page is missing a contentinfo landmark to identify the footer region
Why it matters: The contentinfo landmark (typically a footer) contains important information about the page or site such as copyright notices, privacy policies, contact information, and site maps. Screen reader users rely on landmarks to quickly navigate to these common elements without having to read through the entire page. When the footer lacks proper landmark markup, users must search manually through the content to find this information, which is inefficient and may cause them to miss important legal notices or helpful links. The contentinfo landmark provides a consistent, predictable way to access this supplementary information across all pages.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks to quickly find footer information, keyboard users who want to efficiently skip to footer content, users with cognitive disabilities who rely on consistent page structure, and users who need to frequently access footer links like privacy policies or contact information
How to fix: Use the HTML5 <footer> element for your page footer (it has an implicit role of contentinfo when it's not nested inside article, aside, main, nav, or section elements). Alternatively, add role="contentinfo" to the container holding your footer content. Ensure there's only one contentinfo landmark per page at the top level. The footer should contain information about the page or site, not primary content.

================================================================================

## WarnNoH1

ID: WarnNoH1
Type: Warning
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: headings
Description: Page is missing an h1 element to identify the main topic
Why it matters: The h1 is the most important heading on a page - it tells users what the page is about, similar to a chapter title in a book. Screen reader users often navigate directly to the h1 first to understand the page purpose. Without it, users must guess the page topic from other cues like the title or URL. The h1 also establishes the starting point for the heading hierarchy. Search engines use the h1 to understand page content, and browser extensions that generate page outlines will be missing the top level. Think of the h1 as answering "What is this page about?" - without it, users lack this fundamental context.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who jump to the h1 to understand page purpose, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear indication of page topic, SEO and users finding your content through search engines, users of browser tools that generate page outlines or tables of contents
How to fix: Add exactly one h1 element that describes the main topic or purpose of the page. It should be unique to that page (not the same site-wide). Place it at the beginning of your main content, typically inside the main landmark. The h1 text should make sense if read in isolation and match user expectations based on how they arrived at the page. Don't use the site name as the h1 - use the specific page topic.

## WarnNoNavigationLandmark

ID: WarnNoNavigationLandmark
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
Touchpoint: landmarks
Description: Page has no navigation landmarks to identify navigation regions
Why it matters: Navigation landmarks identify areas containing navigation links, allowing users to quickly jump to menus without reading through other content. Most web pages have multiple navigation areas (main menu, footer links, sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs) but without proper markup, these are just lists of links mixed with other content. Screen reader users must hunt for navigation areas or listen to all links to find what they need. Navigation landmarks make these areas immediately discoverable and allow users to skip between different navigation regions efficiently.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who use landmarks to find navigation menus quickly, keyboard users navigating complex sites with multiple menus, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear identification of navigation areas, and users with motor disabilities who need to minimize unnecessary navigation
How to fix: Wrap navigation areas in <nav> elements or add role="navigation" to containers with navigation links. If you have multiple navigation areas, label each one with aria-label to distinguish them (e.g., aria-label="Main navigation", aria-label="Footer links", aria-label="Breadcrumb"). Not every group of links needs to be a navigation landmark - use it for major navigation blocks that users would want to find quickly.

================================================================================

## WarnPageTitleTooLong

ID: WarnPageTitleTooLong
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Page title is {length} characters long, exceeding the recommended 60 character limit
Why it matters: The title "{title}" with {length} characters will get cut off in browser tabs (typically around 30 characters) and search engine results (typically 50-60 characters), losing important information. The most important information might be at the end and never seen. Screen reader users have to listen to lengthy titles repeatedly.
Who it affects: Users with multiple tabs open who see truncated titles, users searching for content who can't see full titles in results, screen reader users who must listen to long titles repeatedly, mobile users with even less space for title display
How to fix: Shorten the title from {length} to under 60 characters. Place the most important, unique information first. Remove unnecessary words like "Welcome to" or "This page contains". Test how titles appear in browser tabs and search results to ensure key information is visible.

================================================================================

## WarnPageTitleTooShort

ID: WarnPageTitleTooShort
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Page title "{found}" is only {length} characters, potentially not descriptive enough
Why it matters: The title "{found}" with only {length} characters doesn't provide enough context, especially when users have multiple tabs open or are browsing history. Users can't distinguish between different sites with the same generic titles. Screen reader users hearing page titles announced need more descriptive information to understand where they are.
Who it affects: Users with multiple browser tabs who need to distinguish between pages, screen reader users who rely on descriptive titles for context, users browsing history or bookmarks, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear page identification
How to fix: Expand "{found}" to be more descriptive by including the site name and page purpose. Aim for 20-60 characters that clearly describe the page content. Ensure each page has a unique, descriptive title that makes sense out of context.

## WarnTitleAttrFound

ID: WarnTitleAttrFound
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: title
Description: Title attribute is being used on an element, which has significant accessibility limitations
Why it matters: Title attributes are problematic for accessibility: they don't appear on mobile devices or touch screens, keyboard users cannot access them without a mouse, screen readers handle them inconsistently (some ignore them, some read them), they disappear quickly making them hard to read for users with motor or cognitive disabilities, they cannot be styled or resized for users with low vision, and they're not translated by browser translation tools. Using title attributes for important information excludes many users from accessing that content.
Who it affects: Mobile and touch screen users who never see title tooltips, keyboard-only users who cannot hover to trigger tooltips, screen reader users who may not hear title content reliably, users with motor disabilities who cannot hover precisely, users with cognitive disabilities who need more time to read, users with low vision who cannot resize tooltip text, and users relying on translation tools
How to fix: Replace title attributes with visible, persistent text that all users can access. For form fields, use visible <label> elements or aria-label. For links and buttons, ensure the visible text is descriptive. For abbreviations, provide the full text on first use. For supplementary information, use visible helper text, details/summary elements, or clickable info icons. Only use title attributes for progressive enhancement where the information duplicates visible content. Never rely on title alone for important information.

How to fix: Ensure PDFs are accessible (tagged, structured, with text content) or provide HTML alternatives. Ensure that the user knows the link is to a PDF. Ensure the attribute hreflang is provided if the PDF is in a different language to that of the current page and that the language of the PDF is indicated in the link text.
