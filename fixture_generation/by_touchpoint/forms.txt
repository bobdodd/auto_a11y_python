ID: ErrLabelContainsMultipleFields
Type: Error
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 3.3.2
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Single label contains {count} form fields
Why it matters: A label containing {count} fields creates ambiguity about which field it describes. Screen readers will associate this label with all {count} fields, making it unclear which field is which.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who need clear field identification, users with cognitive disabilities who need simple relationships
How to fix: Split the label so each of the {count} fields has its own dedicated label. Use fieldset and legend for grouped fields if they're related.

Why it matters: Placeholder text disappears when users start typing, leaving no persistent label for reference.
Who it affects: Users with cognitive disabilities, users who need to review form data, screen reader users.
How to fix: Add proper label elements or aria-label, use placeholder only for supplementary hints or examples.

================================================================================

## ErrTitleAsOnlyLabel

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Forms/ErrTitleAsOnlyLabel_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/ErrTitleAsOnlyLabel_003_violations_various_inputs.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/ErrTitleAsOnlyLabel.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/ErrTitleAsOnlyLabel_002_correct_proper_labels.html

ID: ErrTitleAsOnlyLabel
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A), 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form element is using title attribute as its only accessible label, which is insufficient for accessibility
Why it matters: When title is the only labeling mechanism for a form field, many users cannot determine what information to enter. Title attributes are not announced by screen readers when navigating forms in normal mode, don't appear on mobile devices, cannot be accessed by keyboard users, and disappear too quickly for many users to read. This makes the form field essentially unlabeled for a large portion of users, preventing them from completing forms successfully.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who won't hear the field's purpose when navigating the form, mobile users who cannot see title tooltips at all, keyboard users who cannot hover to see the tooltip, users with motor disabilities who struggle with precise hovering, users with cognitive disabilities who need persistent labels as memory aids, and voice control users who cannot reference fields without visible labels
How to fix: Add a proper visible <label> element associated with the form field using the 'for' attribute. If space is limited, use placeholder text in addition to (not instead of) a label. For complex layouts, consider using aria-labelledby to reference existing visible text. If you must use aria-label, ensure it's descriptive and consider adding visible text for sighted users. Never rely solely on title attributes for labeling form fields - they should only supplement proper labels, not replace them.

================================================================================

## ErrUnlabelledField

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Forms/ErrUnlabelledField_002_correct_with_labels.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/ErrUnlabelledField_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/ErrUnlabelledField.html

ID: ErrUnlabelledField
Type: Error
Impact: High
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form input element lacks an accessible name through <label>, aria-label, aria-labelledby, or other labeling methods, leaving the field's purpose undefined for assistive technologies
Why it matters: Without labels, users cannot determine what information to enter, leading to form errors, abandoned transactions, and inability to complete critical tasks. Screen readers announce only the field type like "edit" or "combo box" without context, forcing users to guess based on surrounding content that may not be programmatically associated. This creates barriers for independent form completion and may result in users submitting incorrect information or being unable to proceed.
Who it affects: Blind and low vision users using screen readers who hear no field description when navigating forms, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels to understand what information is required, users with motor disabilities using voice control who cannot reference unlabeled fields by name, mobile users where placeholder text may disappear on focus, and users who rely on browser autofill features that depend on proper field labeling
How to fix: Add explicit <label> elements with for attribute matching the input's id (preferred method), use aria-label for simple labels when visual text isn't needed, implement aria-labelledby to reference existing visible text, ensure placeholder text is not the only labeling method as it disappears on input, wrap inputs and label text together for implicit association, and verify all form controls including select elements, textareas, and custom widgets have accessible names

================================================================================

## InfoFieldLabelledUsingAriaLabel

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Forms/InfoFieldLabelledUsingAriaLabel_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/InfoFieldLabelledUsingAriaLabel_002_correct_visible_labels.html

ID: InfoFieldLabelledUsingAriaLabel
Type: Info
Impact: N/A
WCAG: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Field is labeled using aria-label="{found}", which is valid but may have usability considerations
Why it matters: While aria-label="{found}" is a valid way to label this form field, it has limitations: the label "{found}" is not visible on screen which can confuse sighted users, voice control users cannot reference the field by the visible text "{found}", the label won't be automatically translated by browser translation tools, and users with cognitive disabilities benefit from visible labels as memory aids.
Who it affects: Sighted users who can't see "{found}" as a label, voice control users who can't say "click {found}", users relying on browser translation, users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from persistent visible labels
How to fix: Consider if a visible label showing "{found}" would better serve all users. If space permits, use a visible <label> element with the text "{found}". If aria-label must be used, ensure "{found}" is clear and descriptive. Consider adding visible helper text or placeholder text to provide visual context.

## WarnFieldLabelledByElementThatIsNotALabel

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFieldLabelledByElementThatIsNotALabel_002_correct_label_elements.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFieldLabelledByElementThatIsNotALabel_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFieldLabelledByElementThatIsNotALabel.html

ID: WarnFieldLabelledByElementThatIsNotALabel
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1, 3.3.2
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Field labeled by element '{found}' that is not semantically a label
Why it matters: The element with ID '{found}' is being used as a label but is not a <label> element. While this can work, non-label elements may not convey proper semantic meaning or behave as users expect.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who may not receive proper label semantics
How to fix: Consider using a proper <label> element, or ensure the element '{found}' contains appropriate descriptive text for the field

================================================================================

## WarnFieldLabelledByMultipleElements

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFieldLabelledByMultipleElements_002_correct_simple_labels.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFieldLabelledByMultipleElements.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFieldLabelledByMultipleElements_001_violations_basic.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFieldLabelledByMultipleElements_002_correct_single_label.html

ID: WarnFieldLabelledByMultipleElements
Type: Warning
Impact: Low
WCAG: 3.3.2
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Field is labeled by {count} elements via aria-labelledby
Why it matters: When {count} elements label a field, they will be concatenated together. The order and combination may not make sense or could be confusing when read as a single label.
Who it affects: Screen reader users who hear all {count} labels concatenated together
How to fix: Review the {count} labeling elements to ensure they make sense when read together in order. Consider if a single, clear label would be better.

================================================================================

## WarnFormHasNoLabel

⚠️  Has old fixtures to replace:
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFormHasNoLabel.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFormHasNoLabel_002_correct_with_labels.html
  - Fixtures/Forms/WarnFormHasNoLabel_001_violations_basic.html

ID: WarnFormHasNoLabel
Type: Warning
Impact: Medium
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
Touchpoint: forms
Description: Form element has no accessible name to describe its purpose
Why it matters: When a form lacks an accessible name, screen reader users hear only "form" without knowing what the form does - is it a search form, login form, contact form, or something else? Users navigating by landmarks or forms need to understand each form's purpose to decide whether to interact with it. This is especially important on pages with multiple forms. Without proper labeling, users might fill out the wrong form, skip important forms, or waste time exploring forms to understand their purpose.
Who it affects: Screen reader users navigating by forms or landmarks who need to identify form purposes, users with cognitive disabilities who need clear labels to understand what each form does, and keyboard users who tab through forms and need context about what they're interacting with
How to fix: Add an accessible name to the form element using aria-label (e.g., aria-label="Contact form") or aria-labelledby to reference a visible heading. If the form has a visible heading immediately before it, use aria-labelledby to point to that heading's ID. For search forms, "Search" is usually sufficient. The label should clearly indicate the form's purpose and be unique if there are multiple forms on the page.
